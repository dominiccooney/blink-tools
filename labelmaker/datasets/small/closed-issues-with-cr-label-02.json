Open video through YouTube\r\n2. Place video in second Chrome window on second monitor\r\n3. Use browser as usual in original Chrome window on primary screen\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nVideo should play smoothly and system should not be affected negatively.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nProblem #1 - If I stream video on my second screen (I'm using a laptop connected to a monitor via HDMI) it becomes extremely choppy and glitchy. It seems as if it is constantly rocking back and forth between ± 0.2 seconds of where it should be. So the video will move forward as it should, then it will jump backwards incrementally for a brief moment, after which it continues back to where it should be, repeat ad infinitum. The audio during all of this is fine.\r\n\r\nProblem #2 - If I have 2+ windows of chrome open, one streaming video, and I move the streaming video window to the second monitor, my entire computer becomes sluggish. Not only chrome, but the entire computer. My CPU usage also skyrockets while the video is still loading - significantly more so than it doe if I let the video load on my primary laptop screen.

I tried just looping and making the whole thing async, and it works, but... ugh. event would be nicer.\r\n- introduce an event for when script execution actually starts. there must be a URL then.\r\n\r\nPutting the site isolation label here because that's what it's blocking.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471898/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471898"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471898"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"kal...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/101552155141443233313/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/dcheng@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dcheng@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105065627033976518343/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jap...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jochen@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jochen@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":471898},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Extensions"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Sandbox-SiteIsolation"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101552155141443233313/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"kal...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Started"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DUQBQn47eCl7ImA9XRRUGE8.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471894"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-30T22:56:58.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-31T18:42:33.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"DingDong: support type-C monitors"},"content":{"$t":"DingDong's firmware currently only handles the DP monitor to Type-C device case.\r\nBy spec, the dongle should work in reverse as well.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471894/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471894"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471894"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"dnschn...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/112503277681040789158/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/adamrodr...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"adamrodr...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jfan...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jfan...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":471894},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-OS-Firmware-EC"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/tbroch@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"tbroch@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DUUBR347eCl7ImA9XRRbFkU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471891"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-30T22:49:19.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-10T17:34:16.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"double finger double tap to zoom should update the zoom info area in the address bar"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       : 43.0.2351.0\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.10.3\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1. double tap with two fingers somewhere on a page\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat is the expected result?\u003c/b\u003e\nthere to be some indication that the browser made this change, rather than the website\r\n\r\nWhat happens instead of that?\r\nnothing\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.

Since Cmd-0 resets the zoom, as though I had Cmd-+ed up until that point, it would be cool if the area showing the current page zoom was updated to indicate that chrome had zoomed in, rather than the site\r\n\r\nA slightly worse issue is that if you do zoom (via Cmd-+) after double tapping, the zoom percentage displayed starts off at 100 (e.g. far smaller than the actual zoom amount is). If you Cmd-0 to reset the zoom level, it takes you back to full unzoomed mode.

It started with special handling of 'remaining times' and was generalized to other messages by sammc in 2013. \r\n\r\nIt has worked, but adding a plural message is a bit cumbersome. 6 messages for a logically single message have to be added [1]  and a caller has to pass a vector of 6 msg ids to GetPluralStringF*(). \r\n\r\nMoreover, special-casing 0, 1, or 2 [2] (or up to any number desired) requires adding if-clauses in the code in the current approach. \r\n\r\nGoogle's other products (which began to support general plural format after Chromium started doing so) including Android took a different approach. They directly use the ICU's message format for plural and gender. \r\n\r\nChromium can do that, too. Translators are already familiar with the format  and it has yet another benefit of supporting gender (although I don't know yet of cases where we need to support gender in Chromium. Some extensions may want to). \r\n\r\nThe only uncertainty about switching to this method is whether grit (and the corresponding grd  importer/exporter) 'interfere with'  any 'special characters' (such as open and closing braces) used in the ICU message syntax.

Write JavaScript to access geolocation\r\n2. Access page with above JavaScript\r\n3. View scary prompt\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nLet the user decide granularity. Let the site know the general area without prompt.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nGeolocation on the web is…not optimal. So many sites trying to access location, scary prompt saying that site X wants to know your location with no context as to how it will be used, and too hard to revisit the decision.\r\n\r\nUsers will either blindly accept all requests for location, leaving them open to abuse, or they will deny all requests by default, eliminating any utility from geolocation.\r\n\r\nDid this work before? No \r\n\r\nChrome version: 42.0.2311.60  Channel: beta\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.9.5\r\nFlash Version: Shockwave Flash 17.0 r0\r\n\r\nWhy is it either GPS within 15 feet or nothing at all? Many people don't care if you know that they're in San Mateo (for example), but unless you're explicitly a map-related or Foursquare-type web app, exact values aren't necessary but general location is still useful.\r\n—————\r\n&quot;Site wants access to your location.&quot;\r\n• Allow\r\n• Allow, but not my exact location\r\n• Deny\r\n—————\r\nGeolocation on the web is underutilized because people are worried about privacy, and rightly so! Speaking for myself, I'd be happy to give a value modulo 10km as a location default in exchange for not having a web prompt. Good enough to know the city for context but inexact enough to satisfy my comfort levels for general web use.\r\n\r\nAlso useful to amend the geolocation web API to specify needed granularity: exact, within 10km, within 100k, state/province/country, etc. If all your app needs is to know which requests are coming in by state or country, the privacy implications are obviously reduced from exact location.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471758/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471758"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471758"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"mce...@google.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/101618088237388335207/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":471758},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"OS-Mac"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Google"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Location"},{"$t":"TE-NeedsFurtherTriage"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Unconfirmed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"A0IASH47eCl7ImA9XRRbEEg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471757"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-30T15:50:47.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-03T11:12:29.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Race in \u003cwebview\u003e loadCommit/contentLoad: contentWindow is not available"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version: TOT (+ https://codereview.chromium.org/1020193002/)\r\n\r\n0.

Open up a webpage you'd like to print. Here's an example: http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21645247-woeful-approach-language-education-continues-shout-louder\r\n2. Go to the print page (if there is one: http://www.economist.com/node/21645247/print)\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nUser has the option to remove or resize certain graphics in order to allow text to fit better or reduce wasted space.\r\n\r\nUsing the example above, here are some issues with the piece:\r\n\r\npic1 shows an issue that occurs on the print page of the article. The picture caption forces the image left, leaving needlessly wasted space. It would be great to have an option that allows the movement of graphics to utilise wasted space. Wrap around text should correct as the graphic is moved so that the space is occupied. Personally, I'd much prefer to remove this graphic from the printout as it is not necessary for the article.\r\n\r\npic2 shows a very large graphic. For an A4-sized printout, this makes it needlessly huge and the graphic is not used to measure the graph but just basically illustrate the matter. There should be an option to resize the graphic to a more reasonable size so more text can fit on the page.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example. I always stumble across pages that have poorly placed or needlessly large graphics.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nAt the moment, this is not possible with the current print preview. I am aware extensions exist for this: I currently use &quot;Print Friendly &amp; PDF&quot;, but there are some issues with retaining information, font dimensions, and you can only remove pictures (no resizing option available).\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Open the URL above.  This page contains an &lt;img&gt; with the &quot;ismap&quot; attribute set, enclosed in an &lt;a&gt; pointing at the same page.  A script on the page prints the query string that Chrome generates when clicking on the image.\r\n2. Set the page zoom level to 100%.\r\n3. Click the red &quot;X&quot; on the page.\r\n4. Observe the coordinates listed underneath the image, which come from the query string that Chrome constructed based on the user's click.  They should be pretty close to the listed coordinates: 123,129.\r\n4. Zoom to 150% and click the X again.  Observe that the coordinates are now slightly lower (around 119,118).\r\n5. Zoom to 200% and click the X again.  Observe that the coordinates have dropped again (around 115, 105).\r\n6. Zoom to 300% and click the X again.  Observe that the coordinates are dropping faster (around 105, 82 now).\r\n7. Zoom to 500% and click the X again.  Observe that the coordinates are way off, with the Y coordinate actually going negative (around 90,-31 now).\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nIf the user is clicking on the same spot in the image, the coordinates sent to the server in the query string should be the same regardless of the zoom level.  The server doesn't know what the client's zoom level is and expects a coordinate within the image's original dimensions and relative to the upper-left corner of the image.\r\n\r\nThis works correctly in Firefox 35.0.1 and Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.17280.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe coordinates sent to the server are increasingly incorrect the greater the zoom level is.  One might expect that it's sending coordinates in the scaled coordinate system (e.g. a click at the lower right corner of a 10x10 image at 200% zoom would be sent as 20,20).  But it seems the opposite is happening.  As the zoom factor increases, the coordinates sent to the server decrease despite the user clicking on the same spot in the image.  Chrome seems to be improperly compensating for the zoom factor when calculating the coordinates to send to the server.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;smoking gun&quot; is at the 500% zoom level when Chrome calculates a negative number for the Y coordinate--it seems clear that the coordinates should never be negative.\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: Yes\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin? No \r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers?

My description of the expected behavior is based on how it seems it *must* work in order for server-side image maps to work at all under zooming.  This belief doesn't appear to be explicitly backed up by the HTML5 specification.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471530/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471530"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471530"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"br...@electroly.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/117537266058140651025/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110837606391872340358/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"bo...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-04-09T15:59:41.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":471530},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Events"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Image"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-PageZoom"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Input"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/102622162082382831750/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"rby...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":1},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CUYNSH47eCl7ImA9XRRUF0w.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471529"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-28T23:04:30.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-30T10:59:59.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Bookmark manager aborts editing or creating new folders"},"content":{"$t":"UserAgent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.101 Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1.

However short of some obscure css indirectly causing it, I think it would happen anywhere. These two sites are just the sites I am most likely to find myself using a &lt;textarea&gt; frequent enough to run into this almost every other day.\r\n\r\nI've yet to come up with minimal steps to reproduce it but using the below links and typing a few paragraphs overtime. Perhaps switching away to a different tab and back is related, wouldn't be the first type something weird happens to text like losing a font, after some period of time under race conditions.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/Krinkle/sandbox/issues/new\r\n[2] https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Project:Sandbox&amp;action=edit\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nAfter some time (5 minutes?), when adding new characters in the middle of a sentence, they are still rendered in their correct location, but end up overwriting existing to the right of that position. So the existing text is no longer reflowing/rewrapping.\r\n\r\nThe underlying DOM value is unaffected, this affects the rendering only.\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: Yes\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin? No \r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? Yes \r\n\r\nChrome version: 43.0.2343.5  Channel: n/a\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.9.5\r\nFlash Version: \r\n\r\nOver the past few months almost daily when entering and editing text in a plain textarea with Chrome, strange distortions occur.\r\n\r\nIt's almost as if at some point it switches over to some kind of hybrid typewriter behaviour where it's typing on top of other letters.\r\n\r\nSometimes it's only a small area in the input field and the text sort of crosses behind a few words still moving/re-wrapping. See attached video capture for an example (towards the end is the most extreme).\r\n\r\n01-good: User typed &quot;pa&quot; in front of &quot;matches&quot;.\r\n02-bad: User typed &quot;page&quot; in front of &quot;matches&quot;. Notice how the &quot;ch&quot; of &quot;matches&quot; has disappeared (squished after &quot;t&quot;, behind &quot;es&quot; in &quot;matches&quot;).\r\n03-worse&quot;: User has types &quot;pages&quot; in front of &quot;matches&quot;. Notice how more of &quot;matches&quot; has been squished away, even partial characters are now overlapping (&quot;mæs&quot;). And further on the line &quot;ts&quot; of &quot;redirects&quot; got cut off. And on the next line &quot;and I'd like this&quot; became &quot;anais&quot; and &quot;portable became corrupted, too.\r\n\r\nI've experienced this at least since Chrome 38 stable on OSX 10.9. And I've seen it regularly on Chrome  41, 42 and now 43 canary. I always attributed it to some graphics thing in OSX, but I figured it's time to report it.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471436/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471436"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471436"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"krinklemail@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/krinklemail@gmail.com/"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":471436},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Content"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Mac"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Unconfirmed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CkADSX47eCl7ImA9XRRUF0k.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471435"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-28T01:09:33.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-30T18:39:38.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Android Chromoting: switching Bluetooth keyboard on/off disconnects the session"},"content":{"$t":"\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

(https://crrev.com/80295948bf0bc43ebb640afd81fa152e9679fd36)  \r\n\r\nWe'd like that change to be reverted, or at least, the default behavior should be to just follow the Android OS settings for web proxies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally, Chromium developers accepted this patch since:\r\n\r\n- there was a bug in the underlying Android OS that web developers couldn't work around (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=37031)\r\n\r\n- and they could not imagine a valid use case for proxying localhost on an Android device. (https://codereview.chromium.org/796003002/)\r\n\r\nHowever, \r\n\r\n- the bug in Android OS seems to be fixed now. On devices running Android 4.4.2, you can add proxy exclusion settings for 'localhost', and the stock Samsung browser and Mozilla Firefox both do the right thing.\r\n\r\n- our company (Sauce Labs) has a product for developers which *does* need to proxy localhost from Android devices. Sauce Connect opens a tunnel from the developer's desktop machine to a device in our network. This allows them to test URLs like http://localhost:5000/ on the Android device, and the web request will hit the developer's machine. \r\n\r\nBranden from UAkron suggested a special setting for people who needed localhost proxied, but we think that Chrome on Android should follow the OS settings by default. This would be consistent with what all other browsers are doing, on desktop and mobile.\r\n\r\nDesktop Chrome already respects a `no_proxy` environment variable (e.g., no_proxy=localhost). If a setting needs to be added for the people still affected by that Android bug, that would be the right pattern to follow.\r\n\r\nNOTE FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM:\r\n\r\nOne complication is that, when you are setting wifi proxies manually, for some reason, Chrome will still proxy localhost, even though the code says not to do this. So far we are baffled by this. Unfortunately, you can't test this just by manually clicking on the settings in an Android device.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you use a program to change that setting (as we do) then Chrome will, as designed, refuse to proxy localhost. We can supply code to do this if you want, but I assumed you wouldn't want to run a random APK here.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/471400/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471400"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471400"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"ne...@saucelabs.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/114203709091671205910/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/eroman@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"eroman@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/111528590593952048116/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sgu...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":471400},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"OS-Android"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Network-Proxy"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":8},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Available"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0INQH47eCl7ImA9XRRUF04.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/471397"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-27T22:28:23.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-30T16:06:31.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Fix layering violations in redirect handling."},"content":{"$t":"See comments on https://codereview.chromium.org/1017583002/.

Open the gist found here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EaMVrv\r\n\r\n   OR..\r\n\r\n2.

When launching the gist a blue square should appear on the left of the screen.\r\n\r\n2. The css animation named 'First' should immediately transition the square across the x-axis (from left to right) by 300px for a duration of one second.\r\n\r\n3. The animation named 'Second' should begin playing after a delay of one second resulting in the blue square transitioning from right to left (I.e. returns the blue square back to its original starting position).\r\n\r\n4. The net result of combining/chaining both animations should entail the blue square transitioning from left to right and then transitioning back to its original starting position.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\n1. When the animation named 'Second' begins playing it DOES NOT transition from right to left to return the blue square back to its original starting position.

Transpile a JS file (e.g. 6to5) using inline sourcemaps (it may also fail for out-of-line sourcemaps, but I didn't try). The JS file should include an unreferenced behavior. For example:\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\naaaaaa\r\n2. script src the transpiled file and show in browser\r\n3. Open devtools. You should see an error, and the error should link to the correct line in the *source* of the transpiling. This is the expected behavior\r\n4. Now copy the transpiled JS file into a &lt;script&gt; tag in the HTML itself (including the //# sourceMap thingie)\r\n5. Re-fresh the browser and open devtools\r\n6. You will see the same error, but it will show it in the source from an offset. The offset is dependent on the location of the &lt;script&gt; tag in the HTML.\r\n\r\nNote - the JS file should be a long one, e.g.\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\naaaaaa\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\nconsole.log('hi')\r\n//... more\r\n\r\nThis is because the offset may be larger than the length of the script, in which case Chrome will show the error as the last line.\r\nThe attached zip contains the same transpiled file - once inlined and once script-src, where you can verify this behavior\r\nFYI, The transpilations were created via babeljs using: babel --source-maps-inline checkmap.js\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe same behavior should be true whether the file is script src-ed or not.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe mapping between source line and transpiled line was off by an offset in the case of the inline script\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Sync, as a non-critical feature than can sometimes consume large amounts of memory, might be a good candidate for shutdown when memory pressure limits are reached.\r\n\r\nTo do this we can add a MemoryPressureListener that listens to MEMORY_PRESSURE_LEVEL_CRITICAL events and then triggers either reconfiguration w/o certain dataytypes or full shutdown.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n1. Should we do it anytime the critical event fires, or only if we have XXX entries in sync, and therefore are likely a significant source of memory pressure ourselves\r\n2. Should we shut down all of sync, or just a subset of datatypes that are known to be expensive?\r\n3. Does shutting down sync introduce _more_ risk for memory issues? Note that shutdown itself will trigger a flush to disk which can be expensive on its own.\r\n4. Will shutting down a datatype/sync itself interrupt an expensive sync event, such as bookmark model association?\r\n5. Can we detect if a memory issue previously caused a crash, and act on that to proactively shut down sync before memory limits are approached?\r\n6. Should we combine having some actions on MEMORY_PRESSURE_LEVEL_MODERATE followed by more drastic actions on MEMORY_PRESSURE_LEVEL_CRITICAL?

Making and manipulating such images will the task of an extended version of today's cbfstool. In particular, cbfstool will get the following new functionality:\r\n- Improved &quot;create&quot; action that reads a precompiled FMAP file, lays out the image appropriately, inserts the FMAP at the right place, and initializes (multiple) CBFSes.\r\n- New &quot;write&quot; and &quot;read&quot; actions for adding and extracting &quot;blobs&quot; to/from sections of the image that only contain binary data, rather than a CBFS.\r\n- New command-line switch to specify which FMAP section actions deal with.\r\n\r\nSome specific challenges that need to be addressed in the process:\r\n- We need to be able to find the FMAP in the image, both when manipulating it with our utils on the host system and when actually booting on target hardware. We plan to accomplish this by repurposing the quadword of padding at the end of the CBFS master header to store the offset to the FMAP region.\r\n- CONFIG_CBFS_SIZE is needed in several places at compile-time, including when generating the bootstub; however, we want to avoid duplicating information between Kconfig and fmd files. We'll process the fmd file before we compile sources, and generate a header that sits alongside config.h at that time.\r\n- Since flashmaps are going to be come mandatory, we'll need to check in a set of &quot;template&quot; fmd files for common architecture/flash size combinations.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/470407/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470407"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470407"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"s...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/106785070490216378068/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/101081801963572141264/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"reina...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jwerner@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jwerner@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105341522597156443156/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dhend...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/vbendeb@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"vbendeb@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110608823760293821488/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"marc.jo...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":470407},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-OS-Firmware"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106785070490216378068/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"s...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Started"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DE4ASH47eCl7ImA9XRRUFUg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470406"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-25T04:20:56.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-28T15:35:49.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"SafeBrowsingBlockingPage needs an IDN browser test"},"content":{"$t":"As a follow-up to https://codereview.chromium.org/1000333003/, SafeBrowsingBlockingPage should get a SecurityInterstitialIDNTest of its own.

(WebViewTest#testRequestChildRectangleOnScreen, see crbug.com/464693)\r\n\r\nI further investigated the issue and put some logs in cc/.\r\nThe problem lies in LayerTreeImpl::GetDelegatedScrollOffset.\r\nThe outer viewport scroll layer has a maximum offset of (1256, 732), which is exceeded by button #1, which is a scroll offset of (312.5, 1000) in dip.\r\nAs a result, LayerTreeImpl::GetDelegatedScrollOffset ends up returning just the inner viewport scroll offset, which is (0, 268). \r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/cc/trees/layer_tree_impl.cc&amp;l=1132\r\n\r\nThen the scroll offset in BrowserViewRenderer is set to (0, 268).\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/cc/layers/layer_impl.cc&amp;l=1124\r\n\r\nSo the total scroll offset (312.5, 1000) from the scroll delegate (Browser view renderer in this case) is never distributed between the inner and outer viewports.\r\n\r\nNote 1: the button #1 does not even try to scroll the webview beyond its boundary (which is about 3648 x 3648).\r\nNote 2: the maximum scroll offset is calculated here:\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/cc/layers/layer_impl.cc&amp;l=1236\r\n\r\n\r\nBo and Alex, any ideas?","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/470360/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470360"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470360"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"h...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/114255585815495377085/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/boliu@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"boliu@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/114983326451633068013/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"ael...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/gsenn...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"gsenn...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110837606391872340358/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"bo...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/torne@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"torne@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-04-07T23:36:19.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":470360},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"Cr-Mobile-WebView"},{"$t":"OS-Android"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"ReleaseBlock-Stable"},{"$t":"M-43"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Merge-Review"},{"$t":"Hotlist-Merge-Approved"},{"$t":"merge-merged-2311"},{"$t":"merge-merged-2357"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/114255585815495377085/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"h...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"AkQCSH47eCl7ImA9XRRUEkk.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470359"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-24T23:58:01.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-25T01:52:49.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Chrome Mobile Policy: describe your issue"},"content":{"$t":"Chrome Version       : &lt;Copy from: 'about:version'&gt;\r\n\u003cb\u003eURLs (if applicable) :\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eOther browsers tested:\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eAdd OK or FAIL after other browsers where you have tested this issue:\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSafari 6:\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eFirefox 20:\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eIE 7/8/9/10:\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e1.\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e2.\u003c/b\u003e\n\u003cb\u003e3.\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat is the expected result?\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat happens instead?\u003c/b\u003e\n\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003ePlease provide any additional information below.

It seems like the connection is being dropped but that the WebView is unaware that it has ended.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while XHR long-polling randomly kicks in (the fall back for socket connections) and then drops out.\r\n\r\nOver all, the WebView's performance with WebSockets in my case is rather inconsistent/unreliable and I'm unsure if this is something that can be over come.\r\n\r\nRelevant code can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29241105/android-webview-chromeclient-sockets-dropping-connections-using-xhr-falback\r\n\r\n\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/470281/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=470281"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470281"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"chroni...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/116319141198546717760/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/ricea@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"ricea@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-03-26T20:49:55.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":470281},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Mobile-WebView"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-Android"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-WebSockets"}],"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"WontFix"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"A0IGSX47eCl7ImA9XRRbEEo.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/470279"},"published":{"$t":"2015-03-24T21:30:37.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-03T16:45:28.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"kMediaDrmEnableNonCompositing should not be enabled for WebView-based browsers"},"content":{"$t":"Currently, AwMainDelegate::BasicStartupComplete() appends the kMediaDrmEnableNonCompositing switch.

Visit a site with an EV certificate valid longer than 14 months but less than 15 months, with 2 valid SCTs from certificate transparency logs recognized by Chrome\r\n2. You won't see the EV indicator\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nAccording to https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxjZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZXRyYW5zcGFyZW5jeXxneDo0ODhjNGRlOTIyMzYwNTcz certificates with validity length &lt; 15 months should only require 2 SCTs.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe date arithmetic logic of ApproximateMonthDifference() combined with HasRequiredNumberOfSCTs() (both in net/cert/cert_policy_enforcer.cc) doesn't match the spec.  ApproximateMonthDifference rounds &quot;14 months and 1 day&quot; up to 15 months, even though it's less than 15 months.  Then, HasRequiredNumberOfSCTs() checks if it's &gt;= 15.  The simplest fix here would probably be to make that &gt; 15 instead.  This would also be consistent with the other 2 length checks in the same function.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?
