Hope that helps.\r\n\r\n1. Extract the python script and fake certificates to an empty directory.\r\n2. Run the attached script (python test.py), this will generate a HTML file which simultaneously attempts to load 100 empty scripts from &lt;script&gt; tags\r\n3. Navigate to https://localhost:4443/test.html (you may need to change the port in the script if you have something else running on this port), and proceed past the invalid certificate warning\r\n4. I see stall times of around 1000ms before the first script even starts loading - you can change the number of scripts from the variable 'SCRIPTS' in the python script to see how it affects performance\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe first script should load instantly (works in Firefox and IE, but not in Opera - this appears to be a Webkit bug).  This problem also happens with images or CSS files, not just scripts, so is relevant whenever the max number of simultaneous connections per domain is exceeded in Chrome (currently 6 by default AFAIK)\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nnet-internals seems to show many requests being made to get the certificate, and then the TCP socket being closed immediately afterwards with net_error = -202 (ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID); showing the certificate exception is being ignored.  When the same request finally succeeds without that net error everything loads properly.\r\n\r\nHere is my URL_REQUEST for test0.js, you can see the long running HTTP_STREAM_REQUESTs which never bind to a job properly:\r\n\r\nt= 5063 [st=    0] +REQUEST_ALIVE  [dt=10646]\r\nt= 5063 [st=    0]    URL_REQUEST_DELEGATE  [dt=1]\r\nt= 5064 [st=    1]   +URL_REQUEST_START_JOB  [dt=10644]\r\n                      --&gt; load_flags = 136347650 (BYPASS_CACHE | BYPASS_DATA_REDUCTION_PROXY | REPORT_RAW_HEADERS | VERIFY_EV_CERT)\r\n                      --&gt; method = &quot;GET&quot;\r\n                      --&gt; priority = &quot;LOW&quot;\r\n                      --&gt; url = &quot;https://localhost:4443/test0.js&quot;\r\nt= 5064 [st=    1]      URL_REQUEST_DELEGATE  [dt=0]\r\nt= 5064 [st=    1]      HTTP_CACHE_GET_BACKEND  [dt=0]\r\nt= 5064 [st=    1]      HTTP_CACHE_DOOM_ENTRY  [dt=13]\r\n                        --&gt; net_error = -2 (ERR_FAILED)\r\nt= 5077 [st=   14]      HTTP_CACHE_CREATE_ENTRY  [dt=23]\r\nt= 5100 [st=   37]      HTTP_CACHE_ADD_TO_ENTRY  [dt=0]\r\nt= 5100 [st=   37]      URL_REQUEST_DELEGATE  [dt=0]\r\nt= 5100 [st=   37]      HTTP_STREAM_REQUEST  [dt=324]\r\nt= 5425 [st=  362]      HTTP_STREAM_REQUEST  [dt=4977]\r\nt=10402 [st= 5339]     +HTTP_STREAM_REQUEST  [dt=5304]\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]        HTTP_STREAM_REQUEST_BOUND_TO_JOB\r\n                          --&gt; source_dependency = 4467 (HTTP_STREAM_JOB)\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]     -HTTP_STREAM_REQUEST\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]     +HTTP_TRANSACTION_SEND_REQUEST  [dt=0]\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]        HTTP_TRANSACTION_SEND_REQUEST_HEADERS\r\n                          --&gt; GET /test0.js HTTP/1.1\r\n                              Host: localhost:4443\r\n                              Connection: keep-alive\r\n                              Pragma: no-cache\r\n                              Cache-Control: no-cache\r\n                              Accept: */*\r\n                              User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36\r\n                              Referer: https://localhost:4443/test.html\r\n                              Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch\r\n                              Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]     -HTTP_TRANSACTION_SEND_REQUEST\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]     +HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_HEADERS  [dt=2]\r\nt=15706 [st=10643]        HTTP_STREAM_PARSER_READ_HEADERS  [dt=2]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]        HTTP_STREAM_PARSER_READ_HEADERS  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]        HTTP_STREAM_PARSER_READ_HEADERS  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]        HTTP_STREAM_PARSER_READ_HEADERS  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]        HTTP_STREAM_PARSER_READ_HEADERS  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]        HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_RESPONSE_HEADERS\r\n                          --&gt; HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n                              Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/2.6.6\r\n                              Date: Tue, 17 Feb 2015 13:52:28 GMT\r\n                              Content-type: application/x-javascript\r\n                              Content-Length: 0\r\n                              Last-Modified: Tue, 17 Feb 2015 13:51:38 GMT\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]     -HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_HEADERS\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]      HTTP_CACHE_WRITE_INFO  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]      URL_REQUEST_DELEGATE  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]   -URL_REQUEST_START_JOB\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]    URL_REQUEST_DELEGATE  [dt=0]\r\nt=15708 [st=10645]    HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_BODY  [dt=1]\r\nt=15709 [st=10646] -REQUEST_ALIVE\r\n\r\nThe problem is worse if you use a certificate for a different domain so you get net_error = -200 (ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID); in that case I've had stalls of up to 3 minutes or more before anything appears, and over 200k events in the log.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Visit the given URL and open dev tools on the &quot;Elements&quot; tab.\r\n2. Locate the &lt;dialog id&quot;=dialog&quot;&gt; element and expand it. Note its contents (a &lt;p&gt; tag and &lt;button&gt;) are shown inside the &lt;dialog&gt;.\r\n3. In the page, click &quot;Show dialog&quot;.\r\n4. Click &quot;Close&quot; on the dialog.\r\n5. Click &quot;Show dialog&quot; a second time.\r\n6. Click &quot;Close&quot; on the dialog again.\r\n7. Observe in dev tools that the &lt;dialog&gt; element is now empty.\r\n8. Click &quot;Show dialog&quot; again.\r\n9. Right-click the &quot;This is a dialog&quot; text inside the dialog and select &quot;Inspect element&quot;.\r\n10. Dev tools is unable to locate the element (presumably  because the &lt;dialog&gt; tag is now empty) and highlights the &lt;dialog&gt; element instead.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nAfter closing the dialog twice, its contents should still be visible in dev tools and the contents of the dialog are able to be inspected.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe contents of the &lt;dialog&gt; tag disappears. The elements inside the dialog can no longer be inspected.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

The onreadystatechange event will be fired for readyState 2, 3 and 4, but the onload event will never be fired.\r\n\r\nI put some console.log calls into angular.js: 1) just before call to xhr.send(...), 2) in a onreadystatechange callback, 3) at the start of the onload callback. For example one refresh where it happened:\r\n\r\nangular.js:9839 sending xhr request to url=/issue/latest/\r\nangular.js:9839 sending xhr request to url=/region/most_active/\r\nangular.js:9839 sending xhr request to url=/group/most_active/\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/region/most_active/ readyState=2 status=200 responseText=\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/region/most_active/ readyState=3 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 0, &quot;results&quot;: []}\r\nangular.js:9841 XHR finished loading: GET &quot;http://.../region/most_active/&quot;.angular.js:9841\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/region/most_active/ readyState=4 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 0, &quot;results&quot;: []}\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/issue/latest/ readyState=2 status=200 responseText=\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/issue/latest/ readyState=3 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 5, ...}\r\nangular.js:9841 XHR finished loading: GET &quot;http://.../issue/latest/&quot;.\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/issue/latest/ readyState=4 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 5, ...}\r\nangular.js:9778 xhr.onload url=/issue/latest/\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/group/most_active/ readyState=2 status=200 responseText=\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/group/most_active/ readyState=3 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 0, &quot;results&quot;: []}\r\nangular.js:9841 XHR finished loading: GET &quot;http://.../group/most_active/&quot;.\r\nangular.js:9804 xhr.onreadystatechange url=/group/most_active/ readyState=4 status=200 responseText={&quot;count&quot;: 0, &quot;results&quot;: []}\r\nangular.js:9778 xhr.onload url=/group/most_active/\r\n\r\nIn this example the request to /region/most_active/ never got an onload event, even though the status was 200 and responseText returned a valid response. \r\n\r\nThe order the requests are made in differs between refreshes, but it seems to always be the request with the first onreadystatechange event, that has the problem.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

I was using the Chromebook as I normally do.  I plugged it into AC power (same adapter and wall outlet / surge protector combination I've used for months) and when I woke it up from sleep the battery indicator was gone. I attempted system update to .114 without improvement. I then attempted hard reset x 2 without improvement. I then disabled some new chrome extensions I had downloaded in the past week (although nothing in the last few days and it's been working fine).  I then powerwashed x 1 without improvement.  I then powerwashed again and reverted to .93.  That's where I am now.  I posted about the issue here and was told to come here and post about the issue.  \r\n\r\nDid this work before? Yes Earlier today.

Adjust Chrome's width to be the vicinity of 800px.\r\n2. Visit http://codepen.io/bruceontheloose/pen/ByYdNN?editors=100 and make sure to disable the cache.\r\n3. Drag the corner of the browser to make it a little narrower and, without releasing the corner, drag it to make it 1000px wide or so. (It can be hard to reproduce the issue consistently. Sometimes it requires resizing the browser up and down a few times. Also, refreshing the page can help, as long as you start with the browser width at around 800px or less.)\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nTo always display the image at the full viewport width, because it has sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; (and no CSS applied to it to affect styling).\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nSometimes Chrome appears to ignore the sizes=&quot;100vw&quot;, so rather than making the image show at full-width, it shows it at its normal size when the browser is wider than it.\r\n\r\nDoes it occur on multiple sites: Yes\r\n\r\nIs it a problem with a plugin? N/A \r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers? N/A \r\n\r\nChrome version: 40.0.2214.111 (Official Build)   Channel: stable\r\nOS Version: OS X 10.8.5 (not Retina screen)\r\nFlash Version: 16.0.0.305\r\n\r\nI tried a few default src images while troubleshooting, leaving the srcset and sizes values consistent. What I found is that, when the issue occurs, the image that is unaffected by sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; is the one specified in the src. In other words, in the attached screenshots, if the image shown is 800x600, it happened when src=&quot;http://placehold.it/800x600/0000cc&quot;. Similarly, if the image in the screenshot is 1200x900, it happened when src=&quot;http://placehold.it/1200x900/0000cc&quot;, and the same for the 400x300 image.\r\n\r\nHere are the two test pages used in two of the screenshots. \r\n\r\n1) With the 800x600 image set as the default src:\r\nhttp://codepen.io/bruceontheloose/pen/ByYdNN?editors=100\r\n\r\n2) With the 1200x900 image set as the default src:\r\nhttp://codepen.io/bruceontheloose/pen/EaQvWp?editors=100\r\n\r\nThe other screenshots are from tests I ran locally so you'd know it isn't unique to Codepen. I've also had it happen with other images of the same dimensions; that's how I first discovered it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I found I could make the issue happen in or out of Device Mode.\r\n\r\nAll tests were done on a 13&quot; MacBook Air.\r\n\r\nThank you!","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/458714/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=458714"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/458714"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"br...@bruceontheloose.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/100360385021294165186/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103871821681143305277/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"durga.be...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":458714},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Blink-CSS"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-All"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106151992165875567633/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"y...@yoav.ws"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Untriaged"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0ACQn47eCl7ImA9XRRaEEg.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/458713"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-14T00:02:52.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-14T22:49:23.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"platform_BootPerfServer/seconds_shutdown_time regressing on Rambi boards"},"content":{"$t":"See perf dashboard:\r\n\r\nhttps://chromeperf.appspot.com/report?masters=ChromeOSPerf&amp;bots=cros-squawks&amp;tests=platform_BootPerfServer%2Fseconds_shutdown_time&amp;checked=all&amp;start_rev=20540020596700000&amp;end_rev=22970000676400000\r\n\r\nI see an upward trend and on 41 vs 40 and prev milestones.\r\n\r\nAn average shutdown time for a few 41 builds was 4.96.

Download the html file named 'Chrome40_paintBug.html' from the following location:\r\n   https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scedfe6l2qtxsjq/AAD7YLoBMYeifYdGod2OM349a?dl=0\r\n\r\n2. Open 'Chrome40_paintBug.html' in Chrome (v.40.0.2214.111) and show the developer tools.\r\n3. Enable 'Show paint rectangles' in the Rendering panel.\r\n4. Click the 'record' button in the 'Timeline' panel.\r\n5. Inside the console window call a custom JS function by typing: playAnimation();\r\n6. After the animation has completed click the 'Stop' recording button in the Timeline panel.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\n1. For the animation to complete without seeing a paint rectangle displayed upon first completion of the animated transition.\r\n2. To NOT see a 'Paint (80 x 79)' reported in the resultant timeline recording.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\n1. After calling the custom function playAnimation() the animated transition plays as expected, however, a paint should not occur when the animated transition completes.\r\n\r\n2. Upon viewing the Timeline recording I do not expect to see a 'Paint (80 x 79)' reported due to the animated element having the following applied to it's css properties:\r\n\r\n  -webkit-transform: translateZ(0);\r\n  will-change: -webkit-transform;\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Safari/537.36\r\n\r\nExample URL:\r\nhttp://www.daisy.org/projects/tobi/VideoCSSColumns/\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\r\n1. Goto http://www.daisy.org/projects/tobi/VideoCSSColumns/\r\n2. Open video_first_column.html =&gt; notice how the video playback and controls (e.g. pointing device interaction) functions normally [the video element is the in the first CSS column[\r\n3. Open video_not_first_column.html =&gt; notice how the video initially displays, but as soon as playback starts, the controls become unresponsive, and the video surface is hidden [the video element is *not* the in the first CSS column]\r\n4. Open video_not_first_column_CSS3D.html =&gt; same as (3), except this time a zero-transform CSS3D property is applied to the video element. This trick seems to allow the video to render and the controls to be accessible (although a page refresh may be necessary to see the benefits). Unfortunately this CSS3D trick does not work all the time, for example on some machines with different GPUs.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nThe video playback should function correctly (rendering + pointing device interaction with controls) when the video appears in CSS columns other than the first one.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nWhen the video appears in a CSS column other than the first one, the rendering is broken, as well as controls interaction (pointing device).\r\n\r\nDid this work before? N/A \r\n\r\nIs it a problem with Flash or HTML5? HTML5\r\n\r\nDoes this work in other browsers?

NOT_SUPPORTED is always excluded.\r\n\r\n2) At second phase:\r\n- Traversing the list built at first phase, we decide which tests should run.\r\n- NOT_SUPPORTED tests will never run (even the name is specified by -t option).\r\n- TIMEOUT tests will run only when --include-timeout is set (again, even the name is specified by -t).\r\n- All other tests will run.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounds fairly complicated. And I would like to simplify it as follows.\r\n1) At first phase:\r\n- Include all tests, regardless expectations, by default.\r\n- If any filters is set, follow it.\r\n\r\n2) Decide whether we run the tests built at first phase.\r\n- Run PASS/FLAKY tests only by default.\r\n- Run FAIL/LARGE/TIMEOUT tests followed by --include-* flags.\r\n\r\nFrom the users' (I mean developers' = ARC team) point of view,\r\nthe only diff should be whether tests marked as FAIL or LARGE will run or not when -t is set but --include-* is not.\r\nBefore the change, these would run. After, not.\r\n\r\nI think the behavior change would be ok, considering the following case:\r\n\r\nThere are tests:\r\nFixture1#test1\r\nFixture1#test2\r\n   :\r\nFixture1#test60 (or more).\r\nFixture2#test1\r\nAnd, some are marked FAIL.\r\n\r\nThen, ./run_integration_tests (w/o flags) skips FAILed tests. We sometimes want to run Fixture1# tests only. However, ./run_integration_tests -t Fixture1#* also runs FAILed tests, now.\r\nSomeone thinks this is expected, but others not.\r\nSpecifically, we now do not have a way to exclude FAILed tests easily, except listing all FAILed test names with -x. So, supporting it would be beneficial.\r\nIf we want to use the current behavior (running FAILed and LARGE tests matched with -t), what we need to do is just adding --include-* in addition to -t.

If the MimeHandlerView basically becomes a special type of iframe and iframes will be designed to run both in-process and out-of-process, it may be easy to decide that it should run in the same-process as its embedder.

41.0.2272.32\r\n\r\nIssue description: When navigating to http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/illsville-fight-disease you are presented with a flash video and after skipping the intro, a message is displayed: &quot;A plug-in (Shockwave Flash) Isn't responding. Stop plug-in&quot;. When navigating to chrome://plugins it says Shockwave flash is allowed and has version 16.0 r0.\r\n\r\nThis is the same behavior on a regular windows machine with windows 8 or 8.1 and when navigating to chrome://plugins it says Shockwave flash is allowed and has version 16.0 r0. The difference in windows is that you can install a plugin update separate than the one listed under chrome://plugins that will allow the site to run as normal, but this option is not available on Chromebooks.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Open Chrome (ChromeOS / browser).\r\n2. Go to http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/illsville-fight-disease\r\n3. Click on skip intro\r\n4. Wait a few seconds.\r\n5.

Open any video on any page with HTML5 player, or even local file played with &lt;video&gt; tag, or direct video played by chrome in fullscreen. Original video resolution must be smaller than playback resolution (means 360p played as 720p, etc).\r\n2. Video is pixelated due software pixel resize scaling.\r\n3. \r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nScaling with GPU, we are in year 2015, not 1995.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nI have older computer with Core 2 Quad Q6600, 8GB ram, SSD, but only Intel GMA 3100 (Q33 Express Chipset). Windows 7 64 bit.\r\n\r\nAlready tried some changes at chrome://flags - didn't helped.\r\n\r\nchrome://gpu says:\r\n\r\nVideo Decode: Software only, hardware acceleration unavailable\r\nVideo Encode: Hardware accelerated\r\n(What an irony!

Chrome OS uses this heavily -- the translated IDS_UI_FONT_FAMILY_CROS resource string is used to provide a list of fonts for different languages.\r\n\r\nOn Chrome OS, gfx::ResourceBundle::InitDefaultFontList() calls FontList::SetDefaultFontDescription() to set the default UI fonts. However, PlatformFont also has its own no-argument constructor that can be used to construct a &quot;default&quot; font. I think that this is only called from one place: FontList's default constructor, when the default FontList instance hasn't been initialized yet and no default description has been set (i.e. when first constructing a FontList on any non-Chrome-OS platform).\r\n\r\nAs suggested by Yuki-san (let me know if I misunderstood), it'd be nice if we could remove the concept of a default PlatformFont and instead just have a default FontList. To do this, I think we'd need to do the following:\r\n\r\na) For desktop Linux, update gfx::LinuxFontDelegate to return the full list of families from the default PangoFontDescription and update ResourceBundle to pass them to FontList::SetDefaultFontDescription().\r\n\r\nb) For Windows, OS X (and iOS?), update FontList to call the Font(NativeFont) constructor to construct a PlatformFont wrapping the default UI font.\r\n\r\nc) Remove the no-args Font and PlatformFont constructors and the Chrome-OS-only PlatformFontLinux::SetDefaultFontDescription() method.\r\n\r\nActually, I'm now wondering if we even need PlatformFontLinux::SetDefaultFontDescription() at present. FontList::SetDefaultFontDescription() should be called unconditionally on Chrome OS.

And we would like to enforce the usage of --device flag gradually. Current usage on the bots is like:\r\n\r\nrun_tests.py --browser=&lt;device&gt;-&lt;target&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd we want to make it more general and eventually have the following format:\r\n\r\nrun_tests.py --device=&lt;device&gt; --browser=&lt;target&gt;\r\n\r\nWith --device flag, we currently support the following two for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n1. run_tests.py --browser=&lt;device&gt;-&lt;target&gt;\r\n2. run_tests.py --device=&lt;device&gt; --browser=&lt;device&gt;-&lt;target&gt;\r\n\r\nWe want to update the Telemetry commands on the bots from 1 to 2 for now. \r\n\r\n========\r\n Clank Bots\r\n========\r\n\r\nFor Clank, I am not sure the current exact usage, e.g., \r\n1. Are clank bots running Telemetry unit tests and/or benchmark tests?\r\n2. Whether the clank bots are using either or both of the following two?\r\n    a. run_tests.py --browser=&lt;device&gt;-&lt;target&gt;\r\n    b. run_tests.py --device=DeviceSerial --browser=&lt;device&gt;-&lt;target&gt;\r\n\r\nFor Android testers, we are working on running Telemetry tests on multiple Android devices in parallel (https://crrev.com/902763002). So the flag usage for Android testers will be:\r\n1. --device=android: Use ALL available Android devices for parallel testing.\r\n2. --device=DeviceSerial: Use the specified Android device for testing.\r\n3. No --device flag, or &quot;--device=None&quot; (default): Use one and only ONE of the available Android devices. How to choose the one to use is undefined.\r\n\r\nI think option 2 is used currently. And I think it is better to use &quot;--device=android-DeviceSerial&quot; in case we support iOS devices in the future. Once parallel testing is available, &quot;--device=android&quot; should be used on the bots.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457853/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457853"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457853"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"zhenw@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/zhenw@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":435723},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/zhenw@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"zhenw@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/118068469697315179489/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"d...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/115934952573201461283/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"fmea...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/117088883005658624950/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sulli...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/105270153271635518855/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"nedngu...@google.com"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457853},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Cr-Tests-Telemetry"},{"$t":"OS-Android"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/raywilli...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"raywilli...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DE8DQ347eCl7ImA9XRRbEE4.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457850"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-11T22:55:31.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-04-03T04:54:32.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"OS closed caption settings are not honored by Chrome when available"},"content":{"$t":"Android and Mac have system-wide Caption Settings which allow for customization of captions that make it possible to set text color, background color and other attributes to the text track element, depending on a user's accessibility needs.

Current behaviour hampers implementation of any form of global error handling in a Chrome extension (e.g. for submission to a Javascript error tracking service like bugsnag). It is also inconsistent with window.onerror behaviour for both extension background scripts, and for web-pages in general. In the case of extension background scripts (and extension iframe pages), the onerror handler is provided with full information: a populated message, url, linenumber, column, and error object with stack.\r\n\r\nFull details on how to reproduce can be found in the following stack overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28348008/chrome-extension-how-to-trap-handle-content-script-errors-globally\r\n\r\nBasically, create a new extension with a background and content script, and see what parameters are passed to window.onerror on a thrown error.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nIn the situation of:\r\n- An error being thrown (and not explicitly caught) in an extension content script\r\n- The content script containing a window.onerror handler (or window.addEventListener 'error' handler)\r\n\r\nWe expect all handler parameters to be fully populated with useful info: a populated message, url, linenumber, column, and error object with stack.\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with a window.onerror handler in an extension background script, iframe, or webpage javascript in general.\r\n\r\nE.g. content script onerror hander should see fields like:\r\n\r\nbackground-script.js:2 Caught background script error\r\nbackground-script.js:3 errorMsg: [Uncaught Error: Is this error caught?]\r\nbackground-script.js:4 url: [chrome-extension://iddcjohhadooepihodbngbfobekknpoc/background-script.js]\r\nbackground-script.js:5 lineNumber: [7]\r\nbackground-script.js:6 column: [7]\r\nbackground-script.js:7 errorObj follows:\r\nbackground-script.js:8 Error: Is this error caught? {stack: (...), message: &quot;Is this error caught?&quot;}\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nThe content script onerror handler sees no useful info:\r\n\r\ncontent-script.js:2 Caught content script error\r\ncontent-script.js:3 errorMsg: [Script error.]\r\ncontent-script.js:4 url: []\r\ncontent-script.js:5 lineNumber: [0]\r\ncontent-script.js:6 column: [0]\r\ncontent-script.js:7 errorObj follows:\r\ncontent-script.js:8 null\r\n\r\nWebStore page: \r\n\r\nDid this work before?

"},"content":{"$t":"Hi, I propose that we create a TileCacheController, which is exactly what TileManager is right now. However, I was wondering if there's any buy in for a slightly different approach:\r\n\r\nProblem: We keep deleting and creating a new tile manager for a variety of reasons like output surface going away and switching between gpu/software rasters. As a result, the code in several places has to check if we have a tile manager at the time. On top of that, it would be nice to give the &quot;tile manager&quot; some information (such as existing tiling sets), and when the tile manager goes away and comes back it just knows what the previous tile manager knew. Currently the solution for the latter part is to put stuff on LTHI.\r\n\r\nProposal: Have a TileCacheController member on LTHI (not a pointer, just TileCacheController), and it acts like a proxy to tile manager except it never dies. So, you can TileCacheController::PrepareTiles() { if (tile_manager_) tile_manager_-&gt;PrepareTiles() } if that is appropriate, DCHECK that tile manager exists in other situations. The data that needs to persist across multiple tile managers would just simply be stored on TileCacheController. It would also expose something like TileCacheController::ResetTileManager and ::SetTileManager for lthi to control when it goes away and when it comes back. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.

When i open a page, i dont wanna see a WHITE SCREEN FLASH in my face for 1 second.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nI use a dark theme for chrome, and everytime I switch tabs, open new tab, press a link, A WHITE SCREEN APPEARS FOR 1 SECOND and its extremely painful/stressfull to the eyes. This has been dicussed and reported numerous times since 2008 and you plainly ignore it/ are unable to reproduce it because you have everything in white so white page flashes doesn't bother you.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

Some people suggest using that scriptsafe extension but it's terrible. If you use that scriptsafe then it blocks all scripts from all sites and you end up &quot;allow&quot;ing or &quot;trust&quot;ing all the sites to see their basic content like catpcha modules - this totally negates what the extension was trying to do in the first place. With that extension, I can't even view the developer's own website!\r\n\r\nTry another browser option: I do not want to use firefox or others. Tried it, done that, moved on.\r\n\r\nThe question is: are you (Google Chrome developers) working on an update that will allow people like me to disable webrtc?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJosh","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457492/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457492"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457492"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"joshglas...@gmail.com"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/109971280249653495707/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/juberti@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"juberti@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457492},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Feature"},{"$t":"OS-Windows"},{"$t":"Cr-Blink-Webrtc-Network"},{"$t":"WebrtcTriaged"},{"$t":"M-44"},{"$t":"MovedFrom-43"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/106706733117449910610/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"guow...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":30},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"CUEMQn47eCl7ImA9XRRWEEs.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457490"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-11T00:45:09.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-27T19:01:23.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Cryptohome sometimes fails to build on builders, missing 'GetEndorsementInfoRequest'"},"content":{"$t":"Cryptohome builds sometimes seem to fail with missing definitions.

Enable &quot;Show User Agent Shadow DOM&quot; in DevTools\r\n2. visit http://jsbin.com/minerajubo or http://jsbin.com/wulohiyulu/1\r\n3. Try to use the Developer Tools to figure out what the pseudoelement or pseudoclass or whatever it is that determines the orange color of the highlighted option (be it highlighted because selected or because hovered) in a select\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior?\r\nDeveloper tools should allow you to do that.\r\nBy selecting either the option node or some node in its shadow dom, and looking at the computed values of css properties and at the applied rules on the right, you should be able to find out that.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong?\r\nYou can't. You'll never see that orange color, anywhere in the style panel, nor the rule that determines it.\r\n\r\nIn the &lt;select multiple&gt; example, you do get to see some related user agent style that appears to be determining the grey color of the selected item when it is not focussed (it's so complicated that I can't find it out any more) but even when you have that selected in the developer tools, and go and click on the item so it become orange, the background-color in the developer tools doesn't get updated.\r\n\r\nWith the non-multiple select it's completely impossible to get to see anything that is related with the background color of the selection.\r\nTo begin with, it's painful to inspect such things because when you interact with the developer tools, the element in the page that had focus looses it, hence making it impossible to properly inspect it.\r\nBut even if you manage to previously select it in the inspector, nothing will change in the listed computed styles and applied style rules, of any element (it is painful to test that, because you can see only a bunch of properties at a time, and you watch them in the dev tools while you interact with the node in the page. Then you scroll the styles panel and you repeat, and so on. And then again with another candidate node of the real or shadow dom).\r\n\r\nSome vital information about the styles being applied, be them standard or non standard, be it the normal or shadow dom, something is missing.\r\n\r\nSomething as trivial as figuring out what makes the hovered item in a dropdown orange (and how to make it of another color), cannot be done through the developer tools\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

If we detect accelerometer data, we assume it is. This leads to false positives on devices with accelerometers that do not support TouchView mode (see Issue 454570).\r\n2. For certain features (i.e., power button quick-lock and app list centered mode), we have the hardware configuration files for TouchView-enabled devices set specific flags (--ash-enable-power-button-quick-lock and --enable-centered-app-list).\r\n\r\nTo avoid a) relying on accelerometer data, and b) builting up a huge list of flags to enable on TV devices, we should add a new flag --ash-enable-touchview. TV-enabled devices set this flag (instead of --ash-enable-power-button-quick-lock and --enable-centered-app-list). Chrome cannot enter TouchView mode without this flag (preventing accidentally entering TV mode due to accelerometer data on non-TV devices). In addition, the presence of this flag enables power button quick lock and centered app list features.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457445/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457445"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457445"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"mgiuca@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/mgiuca@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blockedOn":[{"issues$id":{"$t":456244},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/flackr@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"flackr@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/jonross@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"jonross@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457445},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-3"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-Internals-Input-Touch-Screen"},{"$t":"Cr-Platform-Apps-AppLauncher"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-Shell-TouchView"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/mgiuca@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"mgiuca@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":2},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"C0ICQ347eCl7ImA9XRRVF04.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457444"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-10T23:14:53.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-03-19T02:19:22.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"Use NotifyReadyToDraw in cc::Scheduler for the Renderer"},"content":{"$t":"cc::Scheduler should use the NotifyReadyToDraw signal to avoid triggering the deadline early.

Instead there's a `y/a.js` entry under `(no domain)`. Its content is the content of `bundle.js` except for the `//# sourceURL=y/a.js` line.\r\n\r\nIt's broken in a different way in each version.\r\n\r\nDid this work before?

As the spec goes on to say:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the generated code is associated with a script element and the script element has a “src” attribute, the “src” attribute of the script element will be the source origin.\r\n\r\nSo despite the presence of the `sourceURL` comment, the source origin should be the URL of `bundle.js`. So the source map location should be resolved by `bundle.js` URL + `sourceMappingURL` and `sources` in the source map should be resolved by `bundle.map.js` URL + `sources` element (in this case where there's no `sourceRoot`).\r\n\r\nI came to this via bundling with browserify and es6ify (which uses traceur to transpile code). Traceur currently (0.0.84) tacks on a `//# sourceURL=` to each file, so the resulting bundle has a bunch of those and you end up without any of the sources showing up in the inspector.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457419/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457419"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457419"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"goo...@jessemccarthy.net"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/102659318206808492088/"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/kozyatinskiy@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"kozyatinskiy@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/113327504015849312877/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"kavv...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457419},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Cr-Platform-DevTools"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"Via-Wizard"},{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"OS-All"},{"$t":"Needs-Feedback"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/sergeyv@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sergeyv@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"AkEGQH47eCl7ImA9XRRXGEw.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457417"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-10T21:52:21.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-24T22:57:01.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"[App banners] Implement Finch for app banners"},"content":{"$t":"We should implement Finch for the app banners so we can at minimum turn them off if we need to.\r\n\r\nSmall chance that we will need to do an actual gated roll out.\r\n","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457417/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457417"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457417"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"owe...@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/114306280741228901745/"}}],"issues$blocking":[{"issues$id":{"$t":459839},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/benwells@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"benwells@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/t...@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"t...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/114306280741228901745/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"owe...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$closedDate":{"$t":"2015-02-20T23:48:42.000Z"},"issues$id":{"$t":457417},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-1"},{"$t":"M-42"},{"$t":"OS-Android"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/110147100420847335702/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"dfalcant...@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":3},"issues$state":{"$t":"closed"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Fixed"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"DkMGRH47eCl7ImA9XRRXE0o.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457416"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-10T21:51:07.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-19T19:33:45.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"[App banners] Reconnect UMA"},"content":{"$t":"The hooks for UMA counting were disconnected when the AppBannerView was made obsolete.

It's not used to draw UI text anymore.\r\n\r\nI see the following remaining uses:\r\n\r\nchrome/browser/ui/libgtk2ui/gtk2_ui.cc\r\n  We pass the default PangoFontDescription to various Pango functions to get the \r\n  default font family name, size, etc. It's probably not worthwhile to get rid\r\n  of this one; we could write our own parser for the description but we'll pull\r\n  in GTK+'s dependency on Pango in any case.\r\n\r\ncontent/browser/renderer_host/pepper/pepper_truetype_font_list_pango.cc\r\n  GetFontFamilies_SlowBlocking() and GetFontsInFamily_SlowBlocking() call\r\n  pango_font_map_list_families(), pango_font_family_get_name(),\r\n  pango_font_family_list_faces(), pango_font_face_describe(), and\r\n  pango_font_description_get_style(). I didn't see anything similar in Skia for\r\n  getting all available fonts, but we could just query Fontconfig directly\r\n  (which is what Pango does). The Pango implementation is\r\n  pango_fc_font_map_list_families() in pango/pangofc-fontmap.c.\r\n\r\ncontent/common/font_list_pango.cc\r\n  GetFontList_SlowBlocking() does the same thing as\r\n  GetFontFamilies_SlowBlocking(). It returns a base::ListValue of \r\n  base::ListValue (family, localized family) tuples instead of a vector of \r\n  strings. The localization code doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nremoting/host/disconnect_window_linux.cc\r\n  This code uses Pango and Cairo to draw into a GTK+ window; I don't know why or\r\n  whether it's still used.\r\n\r\nui/base/ime/composition_text_util_pango.cc\r\n  This code is heavily dependent on Pango. This might be a requirement for doing\r\n  IME in a GTK+ app.\r\n\r\nharfbuzz-ng also has comments in its build files mentioning a pangoft2 dependency, but I don't see Pango being used anywhere in it and think the mentions might be stale.\r\n\r\nOf the above, I think that the content/ dependencies may be the only ones that should currently be pulled in on Chrome OS.","type":"html"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/457307/comments/full"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457307"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457307"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"derat@chromium.org"},"uri":{"$t":"/u/derat@chromium.org/"}}],"issues$blockedOn":[{"issues$id":{"$t":398885},"issues$project":{"$t":"chromium"}}],"issues$cc":[{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/eae@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"eae@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/108538007702856422875/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"sato...@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/msw@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"msw@chromium.org"}},{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/103913182557360775162/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"beh...@chromium.org"}}],"issues$id":{"$t":457307},"issues$label":[{"$t":"Type-Bug"},{"$t":"Pri-2"},{"$t":"OS-Linux"},{"$t":"OS-Chrome"},{"$t":"Cr-UI-OSIntegration"}],"issues$owner":{"issues$uri":{"$t":"/u/derat@chromium.org/"},"issues$username":{"$t":"derat@chromium.org"}},"issues$stars":{"$t":4},"issues$state":{"$t":"open"},"issues$status":{"$t":"Assigned"}},{"gd$etag":"W/\"A08DQX47eCl7ImA9XRRQFUU.\"","id":{"$t":"http://code.google.com/feeds/issues/p/chromium/issues/full/457306"},"published":{"$t":"2015-02-10T17:37:50.000Z"},"updated":{"$t":"2015-02-10T17:37:50.000Z"},"title":{"$t":"ASSERTION FAILED: node.get() != excludeNode in blink::CompositeEditCommand::removeNodeAndPruneAncestors"},"content":{"$t":"Version: 42.0.2301.0 (Developer Build) (64-bit), Blink @189870\r\nOS: Ubuntu 14.04\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\u003c/b\u003e\n1.

cpu.insn_addr in ndk-translation dispatcher after dynamic branches. They use insn_addr to indicate control-transfer address, but do not touch r[15] (See GenPutReg). Dynamic branches immediately add Ret() (e.g. look at ArmDecoderHooks::BLX_register). Thus GenSetR15() in ArmInsnTranslation::~ArmInsnTranslation is not useful in this case.\r\n\r\nFirst of all this may cause failure of the sync check in dispatcher in debug build. But more important is that the next executed region may read wrong value of the outdated r[15].\r\n\r\nThe agreed long-term solution is not to use r[15] at all (except probably interpreter, which would require dedicated sync). This involves reading of statically known pc from immediate instead of reading r[15] from context.
